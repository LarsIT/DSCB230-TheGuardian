Both sides have traded blame over who started the fighting. Residents in Khartoum were caught off guard, as heavy gunfire, airstrikes, and artillery explosions shook the city. So far 185 people have reportedly been killed, including three people working for the UN World Food Programme, and more than 1,800 have been left injured.</p> \n<p>The violence has not been limited to the capital, with reports of conflict in cities and towns across the country, including in the war-torn Darfur region and on the borders with Ethiopia and Eritrea \u2013 countries that are experiencing their own domestic turmoil.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4d92144a-a982-401c-ba17-9158cc5756a3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WVlQ91l9Ciw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>***</p> \n<p><strong>How did Sudan get here?</strong></p> \n<p>In December, after months of negotiation, Sudan\u2019s military and civilian leaders signed a preliminary deal to end the military rule that has governed the country since October 2021. The point of the agreement was to begin the process of moving towards civilian-led democratic rule. It was a significant moment, however a number of important and complicated issues were left unresolved, including the crisis in Eastern Sudan and questions around reforming the military and security sector.</p> \n<p>Over the last four months, these issues left the RSF and the military at an impasse. The mounting tension between the rival leaders made coming to a resolution in these negotiations near impossible and earlier this month they were paused. Central to this hostility was the question of how the RSF should become integrated into the military \u2013 the army had said it should happen in two years and the RSF shot back with a far longer timeline: ten years. Hemedti then accused al-Burhan of refusing to relinquish control, further straining their deteriorating alliance.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p><strong>Impact on civilians</strong></p> \n<p>The violence threatens to deepen the humanitarian crisis in a country that is already struggling economically. The 2021 coup meant that Sudan <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/exclusive-sudan-cut-off-650-million-international-funding-after-coup-2021-12-08/\">was unable to access</a> billions of dollars in foreign aid and debt forgiveness. Rising food prices, devastating flooding and disease outbreaks have left citizens incredibly vulnerable. Now millions of people are stuck in their homes, reportedly without water or electricity in the final days of Ramadan, too scared to go outside to get food or supplies in case they get caught in the violence.</p> \n<p>Those who are caught in the crossfire have to rely on Sudan\u2019s already frail healthcare system as it struggles to cope with a fresh influx of injured patients. Hundreds of patients have been evacuated and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/sudan-death-toll-nears-100-as-fighting-rages-and-hospitals-run-short-of-supplies\">World Health Organization</a> has said that some hospitals are already running out of critical supplies to treat wounded citizens.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p><strong>The global response</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"548611be114d8b03720333a7592566b09e3181ca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/548611be114d8b03720333a7592566b09e3181ca/0_216_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators burn tires as they protest against framework agreement signed between the military and civilians in 2021\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators burn tires as they protest against framework agreement signed between the military and civilians in 2021</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There has been widespread condemnation of the violence. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on social media that he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d and urged both sides to immediately stop what they were doing.</p> \n<p>However, it is not just altruism that is fueling this alarm \u2013 a number of countries have a vested interest in Sudan\u2019s future. Operatives of the Russian mercenary group Wagner advised the country\u2019s brutal dictator Omar al-Bashir before he was toppled and an investigation found that the group had been <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/29/africa/sudan-russia-gold-investigation-cmd-intl/index.html\">plundering gold in the region</a> to boost Putin\u2019s war effort in Ukraine. As a result Sudan has become strategically important to the United States \u2013 it does not hurt that it is a resource rich country too.</p> \n<p>Neighbouring countries have expressed their dismay at the situation, with the presidents of Kenya, South Sudan and Djibouti planning to travel to Sudan to help mediate the crisis. Across the rest of the continent, the responses have varied; Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister Abiy Ahmed said the clashes \u201ccontradict the longstanding and deep-rooted Sudanese norms and values\u201d while the ruling junta in Chad has closed the border with Sudan and called on \u201cthe belligerents to commence dialogue\u201d.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p> \n<p>An immediate ceasefire seems unlikely \u2013 the fighting is widespread and both leaders have dug in, demanding that the other surrender.

Sudan has found itself in the midst of another crisis, as fighting erupted in the capital, Khartoum, over the weekend between rival military groups after months of growing disquiet over the future of the country and its democracy. It has only been four years since the country\u2019s dictator, President Omar al-Bashir, was ousted after three decades of vicious rule and euphoria filled the streets as people demanded democratic rule. Things have not quite gone to plan \u2013 two of the country\u2019s most powerful generals, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and Lieutenant General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (more commonly known as Hemedti or \u201clittle Mohammed\u201d), came together in 2021 to take power in a military coup. It was an alliance that has proved short lived as al-Burhan, the head of the army, and Hemedti, the leader of the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF), have now turned on each other, with the people of Sudan stuck in the middle. In today\u2019s newsletter, I take a look at the events that have led up to this moment and what it might mean for people living in Sudan. Five big stories Health | MPs in the women and equalities committee have accused ministers of failing to tackle \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cglaring\u201d racial disparities in maternal health despite repeated promises. They have called for new targets to eliminate inequalities. UK news | A serving police sergeant in Plymouth faces three rape charges for allegedly raping a woman while he was on duty more than a decade ago. The alleged offences took place in 2009 and were reported to the police in 2020. France | Air France and Airbus have been cleared of involuntary manslaughter over a 2009 crash that killed 228 people. The court ruled \u201cno certain causal link\u201d with the accident could be shown. Ukraine | Slovakia has joined Poland and Hungary in their decision to stop imports of grain and other food products from Ukraine to protect local farmers. The European Commission and Kyiv have criticised these bans and have asked the country\u2019s involved to offer an explanation for their decision, following reports that Bulgaria is considering following suit. Economy | The price of basic staple foods like cheddar cheese, white bread and pork sausages has increased by up to 80% in some shops over the past year, in further evidence that inflation could be hitting poorer households hardest. In depth: How Sudan got here \u2013 and what happens now Signs that trouble was brewing became clear last week, when the RSF led by Hemedti (above) started stationing forces around the northern town of Merowe \u2013 a strategic location with an airport and an electric dam on the Nile \u2013 and in other major cities, despite objections from the military\u2019s leadership. The moves from the paramilitary group culminated in a violent confrontation on Saturday that is still ongoing. Both sides have traded blame over who started the fighting. Residents in Khartoum were caught off guard, as heavy gunfire, airstrikes, and artillery explosions shook the city. So far 185 people have reportedly been killed, including three people working for the UN World Food Programme, and more than 1,800 have been left injured. The violence has not been limited to the capital, with reports of conflict in cities and towns across the country, including in the war-torn Darfur region and on the borders with Ethiopia and Eritrea \u2013 countries that are experiencing their own domestic turmoil. *** How did Sudan get here? In December, after months of negotiation, Sudan\u2019s military and civilian leaders signed a preliminary deal to end the military rule that has governed the country since October 2021. The point of the agreement was to begin the process of moving towards civilian-led democratic rule. It was a significant moment, however a number of important and complicated issues were left unresolved, including the crisis in Eastern Sudan and questions around reforming the military and security sector. Over the last four months, these issues left the RSF and the military at an impasse. The mounting tension between the rival leaders made coming to a resolution in these negotiations near impossible and earlier this month they were paused. Central to this hostility was the question of how the RSF should become integrated into the military \u2013 the army had said it should happen in two years and the RSF shot back with a far longer timeline: ten years. Hemedti then accused al-Burhan of refusing to relinquish control, further straining their deteriorating alliance. *** Impact on civilians The violence threatens to deepen the humanitarian crisis in a country that is already struggling economically. The 2021 coup meant that Sudan was unable to access billions of dollars in foreign aid and debt forgiveness. Rising food prices, devastating flooding and disease outbreaks have left citizens incredibly vulnerable. Now millions of people are stuck in their homes, reportedly without water or electricity in the final days of Ramadan, too scared to go outside to get food or supplies in case they get caught in the violence. Those who are caught in the crossfire have to rely on Sudan\u2019s already frail healthcare system as it struggles to cope with a fresh influx of injured patients. Hundreds of patients have been evacuated and the World Health Organization has said that some hospitals are already running out of critical supplies to treat wounded citizens. *** The global response There has been widespread condemnation of the violence. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on social media that he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d and urged both sides to immediately stop what they were doing. However, it is not just altruism that is fueling this alarm \u2013 a number of countries have a vested interest in Sudan\u2019s future. Operatives of the Russian mercenary group Wagner advised the country\u2019s brutal dictator Omar al-Bashir before he was toppled and an investigation found that the group had been plundering gold in the region to boost Putin\u2019s war effort in Ukraine. As a result Sudan has become strategically important to the United States \u2013 it does not hurt that it is a resource rich country too. Neighbouring countries have expressed their dismay at the situation, with the presidents of Kenya, South Sudan and Djibouti planning to travel to Sudan to help mediate the crisis. Across the rest of the continent, the responses have varied; Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister Abiy Ahmed said the clashes \u201ccontradict the longstanding and deep-rooted Sudanese norms and values\u201d while the ruling junta in Chad has closed the border with Sudan and called on \u201cthe belligerents to commence dialogue\u201d. *** What happens next? An immediate ceasefire seems unlikely \u2013 the fighting is widespread and both leaders have dug in, demanding that the other surrender. Whether one side can come out victorious is also unclear as they each have their own advantages: al-Burhan\u2019s military has far more troops, but Hemedti\u2019s RSF is better trained and equipped. Neither side will buckle easily. At the centre of all of this violence is a power struggle between two military leaders. As the deadlock continues, and Sudan\u2019s democratic future hangs in the balance, the only certainty is even more hardship for the longsuffering citizens of Sudan.

growing disquiet over the future of the country and its democracy.</p> <p>It has only been four years since the country\u2019s dictator, President Omar al-Bashir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/11/omar-al-bashir-sudan-ousted-regime-president\">was ousted after three decades of vicious rule</a> and euphoria filled the streets as people

Things have not quite gone to plan \u2013 two of the country\u2019s most powerful generals, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/mohamed-hamdan-dagalo-the-feared-ex-warlord-taking-on-sudan-army-hemedti\">Lieutenant General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo</a> (more commonly known as Hemedti or \u201clittle Mohammed\u201d), came together in 2021 to take power in a military coup. It was an alliance that has proved short lived as al-Burhan, the head of the army, and Hemedti, the leader of the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF), have now turned on each other, with the people of Sudan stuck in the middle.</p> <p>In today\u2019s newsletter, I take a look at the events that have led up to this moment and what it might mean for people living in Sudan.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Health |</strong></em> MPs in the women and equalities committee have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/18/mps-condemn-failure-to-tackle-glaring-racial-inequalities-in-uk-maternal-health\">accused ministers of failing to tackle</a> \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cglaring\u201d racial disparities in maternal health despite repeated promises.

Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the deputy head of the military council speaks at a press conference in Khartoum</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Signs that trouble was brewing became clear last week, when the RSF led by Hemedti (above) started stationing forces around the northern town of Merowe \u2013 a strategic location with an airport and an electric dam on the Nile \u2013 and in other major cities, despite objections from the military\u2019s leadership.</p> <p>The moves from the paramilitary group culminated in a violent confrontation on Saturday that is still ongoing. Both sides have traded blame over who started the fighting. Residents in Khartoum were caught off guard, as heavy gunfire, airstrikes, and artillery explosions shook the city. So far 185 people have reportedly been killed, including three people working for the UN World Food Programme, and more than 1,800 have been left injured.</p> <p>The violence has not been limited to the capital, with reports of conflict in cities and towns across the country, including in the war-torn Darfur region and on the borders with Ethiopia and Eritrea \u2013 countries that are experiencing their own domestic turmoil.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4d92144a-a982-401c-ba17-9158cc5756a3\"         data-atom-type=\"media\"    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <p>***</p> <p><strong>How did Sudan get here?</strong></p> <p>In December, after months of negotiation, Sudan\u2019s military and civilian leaders signed a preliminary deal to end the military rule that has governed the country since October 2021. The point of the agreement was to begin the process of moving towards civilian-led democratic rule. It was a significant moment, however a number of important and complicated issues were left unresolved, including the crisis in Eastern Sudan and questions around reforming the military and security sector.</p> <p>Over the last four months, these issues left the RSF and the military at an impasse. The mounting tension between the rival leaders made coming to a resolution in these negotiations near impossible and earlier this month they were paused. Central to this hostility was the question of how the RSF should become integrated into the military \u2013 the army had said it should happen in two years and the RSF shot back with a far longer timeline: ten years. Hemedti then accused al-Burhan of refusing to relinquish control, further straining their deteriorating alliance.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Impact on civilians</strong></p> <p>The violence threatens to deepen the humanitarian crisis in a country that is already struggling economically. The 2021 coup meant that Sudan <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/exclusive-sudan-cut-off-650-million-international-funding-after-coup-2021-12-08/\">was unable to access</a> billions of dollars in foreign aid and debt forgiveness. Rising food prices, devastating flooding and disease outbreaks have left citizens incredibly vulnerable. Now millions of people are stuck in their homes, reportedly without water or electricity in the final days of Ramadan, too scared to go outside to get food or supplies in case they get caught in the violence.</p> <p>Those who are caught in the crossfire have to rely on Sudan\u2019s already frail healthcare system as it struggles to cope with a fresh influx of injured patients. Hundreds of patients have been evacuated and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/sudan-death-toll-nears-100-as-fighting-rages-and-hospitals-run-short-of-supplies\">World Health Organization</a> has said that some hospitals are already running out of critical supplies to treat wounded citizens.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The global response</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"548611be114d8b03720333a7592566b09e3181ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/548611be114d8b03720333a7592566b09e3181ca/0_216_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators burn tires as they protest against framework agreement signed between the military and civilians in 2021\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators burn tires as they protest against framework agreement signed between the military and civilians in 2021</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There has been widespread condemnation of the violence. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on social media that he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d and urged both sides to immediately stop what they were doing.</p> <p>However, it is not just altruism that is fueling this alarm \u2013 a number of countries have a vested interest in Sudan\u2019s future. Operatives of the Russian mercenary group Wagner advised the country\u2019s brutal dictator Omar al-Bashir before he was toppled and an investigation found that the group had been <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/29/africa/sudan-russia-gold-investigation-cmd-intl/index.html\">plundering gold in the region</a> to boost Putin\u2019s war effort in Ukraine. As a result Sudan has become strategically important to the United States \u2013 it does not hurt that it is a resource rich country too.</p> <p>Neighbouring countries have expressed their dismay at the situation, with the presidents of Kenya, South Sudan and Djibouti planning to travel to Sudan to help mediate the crisis. Across the rest of the continent, the responses have varied; Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister Abiy Ahmed said the clashes \u201ccontradict the longstanding and deep-rooted Sudanese norms and values\u201d while the ruling junta in Chad has closed the border with Sudan and called on \u201cthe belligerents to commence dialogue\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p> <p>An immediate ceasefire seems unlikely \u2013 the fighting is widespread and both leaders have dug in, demanding that the other surrender. Whether one side can come out victorious is also unclear as they each have their own advantages: al-Burhan\u2019s military has far more troops, but Hemedti\u2019s RSF is better trained and equipped. Neither side will buckle easily.</p> <p>At the centre of all of this violence is a power struggle between two military leaders. As the deadlock continues, and Sudan\u2019s democratic future hangs in the balance, the only certainty is even more hardship for the longsuffering citizens of Sudan.</p> <h2>What else we\u2019ve been reading</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d38c44b1d930a6bc9185a790f5a881c15fdd760\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d38c44b1d930a6bc9185a790f5a881c15fdd760/0_58_1847_1108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration for Tom Clark\u2019s case for a poverty \u2018triple lock\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An illustration for Tom Clark\u2019s case for a poverty \u2018triple lock\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Elia Barbieri/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>If reading about pension reform makes your head hurt and your blood boil, then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/17/the-big-idea-why-we-need-a-triple-lock-against-poverty\">Tom Clark\u2019s pointed</a> but clear case for a \u201c<strong>triple lock against poverty</strong>\u201d in the UK, for the \u201cbig idea\u201d series, is worth a read. <em><strong>Craille</strong></em></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/17/barry-this-hitman-comedy-is-one-of-the-most-overlooked-and-brilliant-shows-on-tv\">Stuart Heritage calls</a> on all of us to give the critically acclaimed series <strong>Barry</strong> a chance as it enters its fourth and final season: \u201cBarry is so singular, so restless, so terrified of complacency, that it deserves to go down as one of the very best.\u201d I\u2019ve just started it and I agree. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>Remember the viral feta pasta recipe that made the rounds on TikTok back in 2021?

Sudan has found itself in the midst of another crisis, as fighting erupted in the capital, Khartoum, over the weekend between rival military groups after months of growing disquiet over the future of the country and its democracy. It has only been four years since the country\u2019s dictator, President Omar al-Bashir, was ousted after three decades of vicious rule and euphoria filled the streets as people demanded democratic rule. Things have not quite gone to plan \u2013 two of the country\u2019s most powerful generals, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and Lieutenant General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (more commonly known as Hemedti or \u201clittle Mohammed\u201d), came together in 2021 to take power in a military coup. It was an alliance that has proved short lived as al-Burhan, the head of the army, and Hemedti, the leader of the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF), have now turned on each other, with the people of Sudan stuck in the middle. In today\u2019s newsletter, I take a look at the events that have led up to this moment and what it might mean for people living in Sudan. Five big stories Health | MPs in the women and equalities committee have accused ministers of failing to tackle \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cglaring\u201d racial disparities in maternal health despite repeated promises. They have called for new targets to eliminate inequalities. UK news | A serving police sergeant in Plymouth faces three rape charges for allegedly raping a woman while he was on duty more than a decade ago. The alleged offences took place in 2009 and were reported to the police in 2020. France | Air France and Airbus have been cleared of involuntary manslaughter over a 2009 crash that killed 228 people. The court ruled \u201cno certain causal link\u201d with the accident could be shown. Ukraine | Slovakia has joined Poland and Hungary in their decision to stop imports of grain and other food products from Ukraine to protect local farmers. The European Commission and Kyiv have criticised these bans and have asked the country\u2019s involved to offer an explanation for their decision, following reports that Bulgaria is considering following suit. Economy | The price of basic staple foods like cheddar cheese, white bread and pork sausages has increased by up to 80% in some shops over the past year, in further evidence that inflation could be hitting poorer households hardest. In depth: How Sudan got here \u2013 and what happens now\nSigns that trouble was brewing became clear last week, when the RSF led by Hemedti (above) started stationing forces around the northern town of Merowe \u2013 a strategic location with an airport and an electric dam on the Nile \u2013 and in other major cities, despite objections from the military\u2019s leadership. The moves from the paramilitary group culminated in a violent confrontation on Saturday that is still ongoing. Both sides have traded blame over who started the fighting. Residents in Khartoum were caught off guard, as heavy gunfire, airstrikes, and artillery explosions shook the city. So far 185 people have reportedly been killed, including three people working for the UN World Food Programme, and more than 1,800 have been left injured. The violence has not been limited to the capital, with reports of conflict in cities and towns across the country, including in the war-torn Darfur region and on the borders with Ethiopia and Eritrea \u2013 countries that are experiencing their own domestic turmoil.\n*** How did Sudan get here? In December, after months of negotiation, Sudan\u2019s military and civilian leaders signed a preliminary deal to end the military rule that has governed the country since October 2021. The point of the agreement was to begin the process of moving towards civilian-led democratic rule. It was a significant moment, however a number of important and complicated issues were left unresolved, including the crisis in Eastern Sudan and questions around reforming the military and security sector. Over the last four months, these issues left the RSF and the military at an impasse. The mounting tension between the rival leaders made coming to a resolution in these negotiations near impossible and earlier this month they were paused. Central to this hostility was the question of how the RSF should become integrated into the military \u2013 the army had said it should happen in two years and the RSF shot back with a far longer timeline: ten years. Hemedti then accused al-Burhan of refusing to relinquish control, further straining their deteriorating alliance. *** Impact on civilians The violence threatens to deepen the humanitarian crisis in a country that is already struggling economically. The 2021 coup meant that Sudan was unable to access billions of dollars in foreign aid and debt forgiveness. Rising food prices, devastating flooding and disease outbreaks have left citizens incredibly vulnerable. Now millions of people are stuck in their homes, reportedly without water or electricity in the final days of Ramadan, too scared to go outside to get food or supplies in case they get caught in the violence. Those who are caught in the crossfire have to rely on Sudan\u2019s already frail healthcare system as it struggles to cope with a fresh influx of injured patients. Hundreds of patients have been evacuated and the World Health Organization has said that some hospitals are already running out of critical supplies to treat wounded citizens. *** The global response\nThere has been widespread condemnation of the violence. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on social media that he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d and urged both sides to immediately stop what they were doing. However, it is not just altruism that is fueling this alarm \u2013 a number of countries have a vested interest in Sudan\u2019s future. Operatives of the Russian mercenary group Wagner advised the country\u2019s brutal dictator Omar al-Bashir before he was toppled and an investigation found that the group had been plundering gold in the region to boost Putin\u2019s war effort in Ukraine. As a result Sudan has become strategically important to the United States \u2013 it does not hurt that it is a resource rich country too. Neighbouring countries have expressed their dismay at the situation, with the presidents of Kenya, South Sudan and Djibouti planning to travel to Sudan to help mediate the crisis. Across the rest of the continent, the responses have varied; Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister Abiy Ahmed said the clashes \u201ccontradict the longstanding and deep-rooted Sudanese norms and values\u201d while the ruling junta in Chad has closed the border with Sudan and called on \u201cthe belligerents to commence dialogue\u201d. *** What happens next? An immediate ceasefire seems unlikely \u2013 the fighting is widespread and both leaders have dug in, demanding that the other surrender. Whether one side can come out victorious is also unclear as they each have their own advantages: al-Burhan\u2019s military has far more troops, but Hemedti\u2019s RSF is better trained and equipped. Neither side will buckle easily. At the centre of all of this violence is a power struggle between two military leaders. As the deadlock continues, and Sudan\u2019s democratic future hangs in the balance, the only certainty is even more hardship for the longsuffering citizens of Sudan. What else we\u2019ve been reading\nIf reading about pension reform makes your head hurt and your blood boil, then Tom Clark\u2019s pointed but clear case for a \u201ctriple lock against poverty\u201d in the UK, for the \u201cbig idea\u201d series, is worth a read. Craille Stuart Heritage calls on all of us to give the critically acclaimed series Barry a chance as it enters its fourth and final season: \u201cBarry is so singular, so restless, so terrified of complacency, that it deserves to go down as one of the very best.\u201d I\u2019ve just started it and I agree. Nimo Remember the viral feta pasta recipe that made the rounds on TikTok back in 2021? Well, FoodTok has turned much more revolting, as Emma Beddington explores the trend towards repulsive recipes (ironed toasties, frankfurters in jelly).

In this week\u2019s episode, Michelle Williams gives an astonishing account of living alone as a teenager, her self-education and the emotional labour of acting. Craille Sport\nFootball | Mohamed Salah and Diogo Jota propelled Liverpool to a 6-1 win over Leeds, with both scoring two goals apiece. While still eighth in the Premier League table, Liverpool can now harbour the sort of hope fast draining from a Leeds team currently leaking goals at a frightening rate. Snooker | The World Snooker Championship was disrupted after a Just Stop Oil activist poured a packet of orange powder paint over a table, forcing the match between Robert Milkins and Joe Perry to be suspended for 24 hours. Football | Arsenal women\u2019s captain Kim Little sustained a hamstring injury during the team\u2019s quarter-final win over Bayern Munich three weeks ago \u2013 and the extent of the damage means that she will miss the rest of the season as her team pursue the Women\u2019s Super League and Champions League.

The original structure was built to allow soldiers a clear view of any threat to the military base they created at Richborough in Kent, the main entry point to Britain from mainland Europe and often referred to as the \u201cgateway to Britannia\u201d. Built by English Heritage, the charity that looks after more than 400 historic buildings, monuments and sites, the reconstructed gateway opens on Wednesday alongside a display of items found at the site. They include a 2,000-year-old cup made from blown glass from the Middle East, and women\u2019s hairpins, introduced as a fashion item by the Romans. A Roman army of about 40,000 soldiers landed in Britain in AD43 and established control of the south-east of the country. Richborough was a site on a small island in the Wantsum Channel, a stretch of water that separated Kent from Thanet. The Roman troops built fortifications at Richborough to protect Roman ships in the Channel. They built the first Roman road running from Richborough to north Wales. Over time, Richborough \u2013 known as Rutupiae to the Romans \u2013 grew from a military base into a thriving port town where goods from across the empire entered the new Roman province of Britannia. Objects found at the site include hundreds of brooches and thousands of coins. An amphitheatre seating up to 5,000 people was the venue for gladiatorial contests and occasional executions.

An estimation of the value of the royal cars suggests these two vehicles alone could be worth at least \u00a31.4m.</p>"}}, {"type": "contentatom", "assets": [], "contentAtomTypeData": {"atomId": "04b14b1a-cba5-4829-916e-65f6d219a40c", "atomType": "guide", "isMandatory": true}}, {"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>Bentley declined to explain the terms of its provision of cars to the palace, however some loaned or leased vehicles are understood to be returned to the manufacturer after being used by the royals.</p>"}}, {"type": "image", "assets": [{"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/69658cfd40851353fff9976444d3eb557c35380a/0_168_6000_3600/6000.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 6000, "height": 3600}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/69658cfd40851353fff9976444d3eb557c35380a/0_168_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 6000, "height": 3600, "isMaster": true}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/69658cfd40851353fff9976444d3eb557c35380a/0_168_6000_3600/2000.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 2000, "height": 1200}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/69658cfd40851353fff9976444d3eb557c35380a/0_168_6000_3600/1000.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 1000, "height": 600}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/69658cfd40851353fff9976444d3eb557c35380a/0_168_6000_3600/500.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 500, "height": 300}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/69658cfd40851353fff9976444d3eb557c35380a/0_168_6000_3600/140.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 140, "height": 84}}], "imageTypeData": {"caption": "King Charles and Camilla, the Queen Consort, in a state limousine after a welcome ceremony at Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on 29 March.", "displayCredit": true, "credit": "Photograph: Ronny Hartmann/AFP/Getty Images", "source": "AFP/Getty Images", "photographer": "Ronny Hartmann", "alt": "King Charles and Camilla, the Queen Consort, in a state limousine after a welcome ceremony at Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on 29 March.", "mediaId": "69658cfd40851353fff9976444d3eb557c35380a", "mediaApiUri": "https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/69658cfd40851353fff9976444d3eb557c35380a", "suppliersReference": "1249890082", "imageType": "Photograph", "role": "showcase"}}, {"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>While Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the ownership of specific vehicles at the royal mews, it would appear that some are held by the sovereign in right of the crown, meaning they are not the king\u2019s personal property.

It has called for more government support with bills.</p> \n<p>Paul Faulkner, the owner of The Retreat Hairdressing in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, said his energy bills had risen by almost a third and he was locked into those costs after signing a three-year deal because of fears that prices would go even higher.</p> \n<p>He said the increase in the minimum wage this month had added another \u00a3200 a week to his costs while the price of products, such as shampoo and serum, had risen by about 5%.</p> \n<p>\u201cEverybody is finding it hard,\u201d Faulkner said, adding that his suppliers \u201cjust keep putting things up\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe rising cost of energy is a major issue for my business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to continue to provide the best possible service for customers without having to raise prices, but it is unfortunately becoming more and more difficult.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Retreat has made changes to adapt, such as putting in energy-saving LED strip lights instead of chandeliers and asking staff to charge their phones at home in order to save on energy.</p> \n<p>It owns its own building and so has not suffered from higher rental costs, unlike many other similar businesses locally, and has been able to avoid increasing its prices. This has meant the salon has held on to its customers, but Faulkner said some were coming less often.</p> \n<p>Louise Howard-Long, the owner of Architect Hair in Headingley, Leeds, said she was worried about what would happen with energy bills when she came to the end of a fixed deal in September.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cI am lucky because I signed a fixed deal but so many [salons] are going under because of energy costs.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have a lot of regular clients who are still coming in but some are embracing their grey. Rather than come in for a colour every four weeks they are coming in for a cut every eight.\u201d</p> \n<p> Howard-Long said her profit margins had already been squeezed by an increase in the price of hair dyes \u2013 by as much as a quarter \u2013 and other necessities from refreshments for customers to shampoo.

British officials at the G7 foreign ministers\u2019 summit in Japan said they were expecting Russia to retaliate and \u201cmust be prepared\u201d for extreme tactics as it attempted to hold on to Ukrainian territory. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said last month that Moscow was ready for the Ukrainians to hit back, warning that his country would use \u201cabsolutely any weapon\u201d if Kyiv attempted to retake Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. There appeared to be an acknowledgment in Moscow that its forces might soon find themselves on the defensive in Ukraine as Russia\u2019s own winter offensive appeared to be slowing down. Russia\u2019s nuclear rhetoric has united the G7 ministers, who issued a statement after their two-hour meeting on Monday condemning the threats as \u201cunacceptable\u201d and criticising Putin\u2019s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. G7 officials said there was an \u201copen exchange of views\u201d in the talks on the approach to the Ukrainian conflict, including on \u201cfuture prospects\u201d for bringing the war to an end, which Rishi Sunak has said would eventually be around the negotiating table. However, Foreign Office sources suggested that the only way to finally resolve the conflict would be for Putin to withdraw his troops from Crimea and for the west to give Kyiv the tools to finish the job. Despite pressure from Ukraine, and others including the former UK prime minister Boris Johnson, to increase military support \u2013 including more tanks and fighter jets \u2013 the UK believes it is providing what the country needs. Sources said it was already committing its \u201crainy day fund\u201d. A transatlantic group of former senior diplomats and high-level military advisers said on Monday that the war in Ukraine was on course to become a stalemate unless the west went \u201call in\u201d and increased its level of military support. The group said that \u201cdeclarations of unwavering support\u201d were not enough and \u201cactions still fail to match the rhetoric\u201d in a reflection of military assessments in European capitals and Washington. At the G7 summit, the ministers reaffirmed their commitment to \u201cintensifying, fully coordinating and enforcing\u201d sanctions against Russia, agreeing to be more coordinated to prevent evasion of the measures and to target third parties supplying weapons to Moscow. It came as the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, demanded the release of a British-Russian opposition leader after he was sentenced to 25 years in prison by a court in Moscow, paying tribute to Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr for \u201cbravely\u201d denouncing Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin critic, who has twice survived poisonings, was convicted on charges of treason and denigrating the Russian military in what he denounced as a show trial. The Russian ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, was summoned to the Foreign Office for a dressing down on Monday over Russia\u2019s human rights obligations, including the right to a fair trial. Meanwhile, the US secretary of state Antony Blinken\u2019s G7 bilateral talks with his French counterpart, Catherine Colonna, over-ran, prompting speculation her talks with the US had been fraught. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, provoked controversy last week when he said, on a flight back from China, that Europe should not become a \u201cvassal\u201d to the US on foreign policy. He had previously been accused of naivety when he said Moscow must not be \u201chumiliated\u201d and would need security guarantees. G7 officials stressed that all member nations, including France, were united on the need to prevent Putin\u2019s attempts to divide and conquer. Eastern European governments, in particular, had accused Macron of failing to learn the lessons of the war. Without US military and financial support for Kyiv, more than 30 times that of France, Ukrainian resistance would have already crumbled, they believe. In separate talks in Japan, G7 nations including UK, US, Canada, Japan and France formed an alliance to develop shared supply chains for nuclear fuel, aimed at pushing Russia out of the international nuclear energy market. The UK\u2019s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the five countries would use their civil nuclear power sectors to undermine Russia\u2019s grip on supply chains, cutting off another means for Putin to fund his invasion of Ukraine.", "attributes": {}, "published": true, "createdDate": "2023-04-18T05:00:37Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-04-18T00:58:07Z", "contributors": [], "elements": [{"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>Western leaders are preparing for Vladimir Putin to use \u201cwhatever tools he\u2019s got left\u201d including nuclear threats and cyber-attacks in response to an expected Ukrainian counter-offensive against Russia.</p> \n<p>British officials at the G7 foreign ministers\u2019 summit in Japan said they were expecting Russia to retaliate and \u201cmust be prepared\u201d for extreme tactics as it attempted to hold on to Ukrainian territory.</p> \n<p>The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said last month that Moscow was ready for the Ukrainians to hit back, warning that his country would use \u201cabsolutely any weapon\u201d if Kyiv attempted to retake Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014.</p> \n<p>There appeared to be an acknowledgment in Moscow that its forces might soon find themselves on the defensive in Ukraine as Russia\u2019s own winter offensive appeared to be slowing down.</p> \n<p>Russia\u2019s nuclear rhetoric has united the G7 ministers, who issued a statement after their two-hour meeting on Monday condemning the threats as \u201cunacceptable\u201d and criticising Putin\u2019s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.</p> \n<p>G7 officials said there was an \u201copen exchange of views\u201d in the talks on the approach to the Ukrainian conflict, including on \u201cfuture prospects\u201d for bringing the war to an end, which Rishi Sunak has said would eventually be around the negotiating table.</p> \n<p>However, Foreign Office sources suggested that the only way to finally resolve the conflict would be for Putin to withdraw his troops from Crimea and for the west to give Kyiv the tools to finish the job.</p> \n<p>Despite pressure from Ukraine, and others including the former UK prime minister Boris Johnson, to increase military support \u2013 including more tanks and fighter jets \u2013 the UK believes it is providing what the country needs.

Mastodon is decentralized: instead of a single website, it\u2019s a network of thousands of independently run servers \u2013 each with their own moderators and users \u2013 who can interact with each other\u2019s posts, called \u201ctoots\u201d, using an open protocol called ActivityPub. Other social media services can connect to ActivityPub as well, so no one app can monopolize the broader network that Mastodon is part of, called the \u201cfediverse\u201d.</p> <p>All that posed a bit of a learning curve. In addition to learning the new terms, I had to carefully choose a server, which would determine who would be in charge of my data, and what toots I would see most often.</p> <p>Mastodon\u2019s creator, a German programmer named Eugen Rochko, told me at the time that his creation could be \u201cslightly more difficult to grasp\u201d than Twitter. \u201cBut we\u2019re not trying to be an exact copy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make something better.\u201d</p> <p>Musk has appeared threatened at times. In December, he banned links to Mastodon on Twitter and suspended users who posted their Mastodon handles, including Mastodon\u2019s official account. Days later, he suddenly reversed course, calling the ban a \u201cmistake\u201d during a Twitter Spaces livestream. \u201cFucking post Mastodon all goddamn day long, I don\u2019t care,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bca825eb5ae6c15de929b3b5ac094e24d25e0de0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bca825eb5ae6c15de929b3b5ac094e24d25e0de0/0_0_4802_3202/1000.jpg\" alt=\"elon musk with mic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elon Musk banned links to Mastodon on Twitter in December but later reversed course.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nearly half a year later, has Mastodon seized the momentum? Data shows that it saw a huge surge of interest late last year: its monthly active users increased more than eightfold to a high of 2.6 million about a month after Musk\u2019s Twitter purchase. But that number has since dropped to just 1.2 million \u2013 a sign that Mastodon remains far from the levels of hype that would threaten a behemoth like Twitter.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the case that it\u2019s slowed down,\u201d says Nathan Schneider, a University of Colorado Boulder professor who researches collective ownership models and runs a small Mastodon server called <a href=\"https://social.coop\">social.coop</a>. \u201cI think a lot of people came and found it a little hard. Using Mastodon can feel like eating your vegetables.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Is bigger actually better?</strong></h2> <p>Some of Mastodon\u2019s most passionate users \u2013 who tend to be more tech-savvy than average \u2013 say it\u2019s no problem if the community stays small.

Thousands of tweeters \u2013 myself included \u2013 fled to Mastodon: a scrappy social media project designed from its start in 2016 to be resistant against takeovers by billionaires. Mastodon is decentralized: instead of a single website, it\u2019s a network of thousands of independently run servers \u2013 each with their own moderators and users \u2013 who can interact with each other\u2019s posts, called \u201ctoots\u201d, using an open protocol called ActivityPub. Other social media services can connect to ActivityPub as well, so no one app can monopolize the broader network that Mastodon is part of, called the \u201cfediverse\u201d. All that posed a bit of a learning curve. In addition to learning the new terms, I had to carefully choose a server, which would determine who would be in charge of my data, and what toots I would see most often. Mastodon\u2019s creator, a German programmer named Eugen Rochko, told me at the time that his creation could be \u201cslightly more difficult to grasp\u201d than Twitter. \u201cBut we\u2019re not trying to be an exact copy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make something better.\u201d Musk has appeared threatened at times. In December, he banned links to Mastodon on Twitter and suspended users who posted their Mastodon handles, including Mastodon\u2019s official account. Days later, he suddenly reversed course, calling the ban a \u201cmistake\u201d during a Twitter Spaces livestream. \u201cFucking post Mastodon all goddamn day long, I don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. Nearly half a year later, has Mastodon seized the momentum? Data shows that it saw a huge surge of interest late last year: its monthly active users increased more than eightfold to a high of 2.6 million about a month after Musk\u2019s Twitter purchase. But that number has since dropped to just 1.2 million \u2013 a sign that Mastodon remains far from the levels of hype that would threaten a behemoth like Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the case that it\u2019s slowed down,\u201d says Nathan Schneider, a University of Colorado Boulder professor who researches collective ownership models and runs a small Mastodon server called social.coop. \u201cI think a lot of people came and found it a little hard. Using Mastodon can feel like eating your vegetables.\u201d Is bigger actually better? Some of Mastodon\u2019s most passionate users \u2013 who tend to be more tech-savvy than average \u2013 say it\u2019s no problem if the community stays small. Here, things aren\u2019t designed to go viral quickly. There\u2019s no global search or global hashtags. Servers can easily be made private, and admins can block other servers to combat trolls. There\u2019s also a feature to put posts behind content warnings, which users are encouraged to do for sensitive topics. J Logan Carey, an illustrator, has a much smaller following on Mastodon than he did on Twitter, \u201cbut people seem to actually see the things I post on there whereas on Twitter I feel like everything gets algorithmically squashed unless you\u2019re a brand or a celebrity\u201d, he says.

But that number has since dropped to just 1.2 million \u2013 a sign that Mastodon remains far from the levels of hype that would threaten a behemoth like Twitter.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the case that it\u2019s slowed down,\u201d says Nathan Schneider, a University of Colorado Boulder professor who researches collective ownership models and runs a small Mastodon server called <a href=\"https://social.coop\">social.coop</a>. \u201cI think a lot of people came and found it a little hard.

Here, things aren\u2019t designed to go viral quickly. There\u2019s no global search or global hashtags. Servers can easily be made private, and admins can block other servers to combat trolls. There\u2019s also a feature to put posts behind content warnings, which users are encouraged to do for sensitive topics.</p> \n<p>J Logan Carey, an illustrator, has a much smaller following on Mastodon than he did on Twitter, \u201cbut people seem to actually see the things I post on there whereas on Twitter I feel like everything gets algorithmically squashed unless you\u2019re a brand or a celebrity\u201d, he says. Brett Elliff, a systems engineer, says he has been \u201creally loving\u201d Mastodon after using it for a few months: \u201cI only see what I want to follow, and there are actual conversations happening instead of people shouting into the ether.\u201d And Tiffany Li, a technology attorney and law professor, says Mastodon\u2019s small user base \u201cmeans that there are fewer trolls and generally unpleasant people\u201d.</p> \n<p>Another enthusiastic Mastodon adopter is Jeff Jarvis, a professor at the City University of New York\u2019s Newmark Journalism School.

Now he logs in for two main reasons: to check on \u201cthe kind of interestingly diverse Star Trek community there,\u201d and to look at cat pictures.</p> \n<h2><strong>Mastodon versus the monopolists</strong></h2> \n<p>Until recently, the Mastodon non-profit had just one full-time employee maintaining the software: Rochko. The organization is funded primarily through donations on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/mastodon\">Patreon</a>, which add up to around $32,000 a month \u2013 a drop in the bucket compared with the trillions thrown around by tech giants.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s also facing new competition from established names: Meta has said it\u2019s working on its own decentralized social network, code-named P92, which will reportedly connect to ActivityPub.

While Mediterranean flowers and shrubs have recently been a popular choice, gardeners are this year taking inspiration from deserts.</p> <p>One new garden, America\u2019s Wild, features plants grown in the arid conditions of parts of the US. It uses dry planting to exhibit interesting drought-tolerant plants suitable for growing in the UK. These include agaves and <em>Dasylirion serratifolium</em>, a spiny Mexican succulent. The desert area of the garden draws on principles for dry terrain known as xeriscaping, using sandy substrate for a free-draining soil, creating conditions ideal for drought-tolerant plants. The garden also features a specimen tree and cooling walls to create shade and protect plants from being scorched.</p> <p>The Claytons\u2019 garden, Nurturing Nature in the City, features drought-tolerant plants such as echinacea, verbena and achillea and will be mulching soil with waste stone to help seal moisture in the soil below. After last year\u2019s drought, many gardeners are expected to showcase creative ways to lock moisture into the soil and store it in the back yard, whether that is in ponds or water butts. It takes inspiration from inner-city green developments along disused urban railways such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/sep/22/final-stretch-new-york-high-line-complete\">High Line</a> in New York City and Parkland Walk in Highgate, London, with plenty of pollinator-friendly plants.</p> <p>Another garden, The Inghams Working with Nature, demonstrates how to reduce additional watering needs by using water runoff. It is directed into a dry riverbed and then flows into plant-packed swale pits. The garden also features drought-tolerant plants at its highest points, from which water will naturally drain away.</p> <p>Helena Pettit, the RHS director of gardens and shows, said: \u201cClimatic extremes are becoming increasingly common in the UK and our green spaces will need to adapt to weather them. The gardens at RHS Hampton Court provide plenty of inspiration for visitors to try at home to help make their own gardens more resilient.\u201d</p> <p>Climate has become a leading theme at RHS shows, with a deliberately messy \u201crewilding\u201d garden winning the best in show prize at Chelsea flower show last year.

This year at Chelsea, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/20/unpopular-insects-to-be-stars-of-chelsea-flower-show-royal-entomological-society\">slugs and snails</a> will be the stars of the show as gardeners try to demonstrate how to attract wildlife and demonstrate the benefits of species often considered pests by gardeners.</p> <p>Specialists at the RHS have been receiving more calls from members for advice on climate-resilient planting. Last year, a <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/press/releases/RHS-survey-shows-garden-favourites-suffered\">survey</a> of more than 8,000 RHS gardeners found that plants were scorched and destroyed in the heatwave, with the worst-affected being hydrangeas, acers and fuchsias.</p> <h2>Drought gardens: best plants for a climate that is heating up</h2> <p>The RHS experts say: \u201cMany drought-tolerant plants have silver or grey-green leaves, their light leaf colour reflecting the harsh rays of the sun.

Last year, show designers had to install a new ventilation system to help cool the tent down, and exhibitors had to set up extra gazebos to keep plants cool before planting them in the gardens, and were watering in the early morning or late evening when it was cooler. As climate breakdown hits the UK, plants that once thrived in a typical garden are struggling, and garden designers have for some time been experimenting with plants from hotter climes. While Mediterranean flowers and shrubs have recently been a popular choice, gardeners are this year taking inspiration from deserts. One new garden, America\u2019s Wild, features plants grown in the arid conditions of parts of the US. It uses dry planting to exhibit interesting drought-tolerant plants suitable for growing in the UK. These include agaves and Dasylirion serratifolium, a spiny Mexican succulent. The desert area of the garden draws on principles for dry terrain known as xeriscaping, using sandy substrate for a free-draining soil, creating conditions ideal for drought-tolerant plants. The garden also features a specimen tree and cooling walls to create shade and protect plants from being scorched. The Claytons\u2019 garden, Nurturing Nature in the City, features drought-tolerant plants such as echinacea, verbena and achillea and will be mulching soil with waste stone to help seal moisture in the soil below. After last year\u2019s drought, many gardeners are expected to showcase creative ways to lock moisture into the soil and store it in the back yard, whether that is in ponds or water butts. It takes inspiration from inner-city green developments along disused urban railways such as the High Line in New York City and Parkland Walk in Highgate, London, with plenty of pollinator-friendly plants. Another garden, The Inghams Working with Nature, demonstrates how to reduce additional watering needs by using water runoff. It is directed into a dry riverbed and then flows into plant-packed swale pits. The garden also features drought-tolerant plants at its highest points, from which water will naturally drain away. Helena Pettit, the RHS director of gardens and shows, said: \u201cClimatic extremes are becoming increasingly common in the UK and our green spaces will need to adapt to weather them. The gardens at RHS Hampton Court provide plenty of inspiration for visitors to try at home to help make their own gardens more resilient.\u201d Climate has become a leading theme at RHS shows, with a deliberately messy \u201crewilding\u201d garden winning the best in show prize at Chelsea flower show last year. The designers were attempting to show how gardens could be left wild for nature, and in future even become a beaver habitat. This year at Chelsea, slugs and snails will be the stars of the show as gardeners try to demonstrate how to attract wildlife and demonstrate the benefits of species often considered pests by gardeners. Specialists at the RHS have been receiving more calls from members for advice on climate-resilient planting. Last year, a survey of more than 8,000 RHS gardeners found that plants were scorched and destroyed in the heatwave, with the worst-affected being hydrangeas, acers and fuchsias. Drought gardens: best plants for a climate that is heating up The RHS experts say: \u201cMany drought-tolerant plants have silver or grey-green leaves, their light leaf colour reflecting the harsh rays of the sun. Some have a coating of fine hairs on their leaves or stems, helping to trap moisture around the plant tissues.\u201d Five examples of plants that will thrive in drought conditions: The pretty, pink palm-like shrub Cordyline australis brings some colour while being tolerant to heat. Juniperus conifers are drought-tolerant and many varieties have an attractive gold hue. The Judas tree, Cercis siliquastrum, has heart-shaped leaves and does not need too much water. Jasmine plants provide pretty little flowers and a heady scent, and are also able to grow in warm climes. The Abelia \u00d7 grandiflora is recommended by the RHS as it provides dainty, well-scented flowers over a long period in summer, and tolerates heat well.", "charCount": "5057",

Admittedly, there were a few issues. The steam didn\u2019t help, plus I wrapped it in too much tinfoil, so the heat couldn\u2019t penetrate. The main problem, though, was that holding an iron meant I automatically started ironing the package, pressing hard and going to and fro industriously.

Twisted, the social media food brand that just announced a collaboration with Iceland, started out in 2016 and dared us to make the likes of <a href=\"https://ffwd.medium.com/the-company-behind-that-crazy-bbq-chicken-recipe-video-would-like-to-clarify-a-few-things-32bd11dcba24\">deep-fried barbecue chicken-stuffed pizzadilla</a>. Now, says Stokel-Walker, \u201cIt\u2019s been supercharged by the arrival of TikTok.\u201d The app is designed and engineered to \u201ccapture people\u2019s attention as they are scrolling through that endless feed of content\u201d and one good way to do it is precisely \u201cthe outlandish, the gross-out\u201d. It is a notion echoed by <a href=\"https://jonahberger.com/\">Jonah Berger</a>, professor at the Wharton school in Pennsylvania and bestselling author of Contagious, a study of social transmission and virality, who notes that these videos combine surprise and often disgust. \u201cThe more surprising something is, the more likely we are to share it with others. And disgust is a high arousal emotion that also causes us to pass things on.\u201d</p> <p>So is this content engineered to provoke? Some of it, definitely. \u201cI never work to appear genuine,\u201d says Eli Betchik of <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@elis_kitchen?lang=fr\">@elis_kitchen</a>, the self-proclaimed \u201cmost evil chef on TikTok\u201d. \u201cIf anyone asks, I say: \u2018Yeah, I do this for attention.\u2019 I think it\u2019s pretty obvious I do.\u201d It is a mark of Betchik\u2019s evil genius that every video of theirs makes me shout \u201cNo!\u201d in genuine anger at some point. Betchik was behind the much-reviled potato crisp mash, and a horrifying sandwich made of blended peas, pineapple, cheese and nuts, with the bread coated with mayo, then fried, among other outrages.</p> <p>Betchik is a <a href=\"https://www.betchik.com/\">fine art jeweller</a>, who started their channel after discovering TikTok at jewellery school. \u201cI thought, I already love experimenting with food and trying new things \u2013 I could probably take that a few steps further and use it for some good old-fashioned shock-value entertainment.\u201d Their first video was fried mayonnaise.

It was moist, it had great flavour.\u201d</p> <p>Jane ended up in the realm of what is sometimes called \u201crage-bait\u201d cooking accidentally. Her early videos, she says, were straight instructional content, but she pivoted when her fried chicken recipe went viral. \u201cIt got 31m views, 3,000 comments,\u201d says Jane \u2013 this is, of course, highly populated TikTok territory, the hashtag #FoodTikTok had accumulated 112bn views by the end of 2022, for example. \u201cI thought it would be positive but it was more like: \u2018You\u2019re the worst chef I\u2019ve ever seen.\u2019 So I realised that I would have no idea what people were going to think of my videos.\u201d</p> <p>She started focusing on finding the \u201ccraziest combinations\u201d, including one titled \u201cI learned this hotdog trick in England\u201d, in which she makes jelly from pickle juice, adds frankfurters and eats it in a bread bun. \u201cThat is absolutely not English,\u201d I challenge her hotly, TikTok commenter style. \u201cI can\u2019t remember; it was from some sort of British something,\u201d she says. \u201cI was going to ask you why you make pickle juice jelly!\u201d What makes people angriest, though, she says, is her cooking techniques. \u201cAs soon as you cook for the internet you open yourself up to all the critics who are so specific in the way they cook.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c681fee56db350006914e45c1dfc969e70f6ff71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c681fee56db350006914e45c1dfc969e70f6ff71/0_0_2006_1658/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ramsay baiting \u2026 @myjanebrain makes chicken in a pumpkin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"827\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ramsay baiting \u2026 @myjanebrain makes chicken in a pumpkin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amyjanebrain, @gordonramsayofficial/Tik Tok</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both Jane and Eli are clear that their content is knowingly provocative rather than instructional, whether viewers understand that or not. \u201cA lot of people take this content at face value when you have to remember we\u2019re through the looking-glass on social media, where these things are being deliberately gamed for the benefit of those that create it,\u201d says Stokel-Walker. All attention is good attention, since views and shares \u2013 including the genre of angry or incredulous \u201cduet\u201d videos where other creators (including Ramsay) comment on their depravity \u2013 are the point. That\u2019s how you make money after all: successful TikTokers can become part of the app\u2019s creator fund and get paid \u2013 admittedly pennies \u2013 per view. Stokel-Walker says that success can allow creators to pivot to the kind of genuinely lucrative mainstream <a href=\"https://retailtimes.co.uk/twisted-announces-a-new-frozen-food-collaboration-with-iceland-designed-to-make-eating-as-fun-and-social-as-possible/\">collaborations that Twisted has managed</a>.</p> <p>There is another possibly upsetting angle: fetish. \u201cVideos where they point a lot and touch things and make super-repulsive stuff are apparently fetish,\u201d a baker friend tells me airily, when I inquire if she uses TikTok recipes. It turns out there\u2019s a fairly widespread suspicion this is a thing. The messier foods could fulfil a \u201csploshing\u201d fetish: <a href=\"https://www.insidehook.com/article/internet/gross-viral-food-hacks-rick-lax-facebook-sploshing-fetish\">getting sexual gratification from food mess</a>. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this aired,\u201d says Stokel-Walker. \u201cCertainly, it appeals to your senses. It\u2019s like a slow-motion car crash in food form, where you\u2019re like, how more disgusting can this get?\u201d TikTok user <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lenarae.lh?lang=en\">@lenarae.lh</a> analyses food videos and pronounces them fetish or non-fetish on the basis of how the women \u2013 it is almost always women \u2013 use their hands, splash or squirt stuff suggestively or massage phallic things. A friend also directs me to the work of a creator called <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cedriklorenzen?lang=en\">@cedriklorenzen</a> who specialises in whacking pieces of raw meat, dribbling, drizzling and taking his top off. It\u2019s a better appetite suppressant than Ozempic: after watching, I never want to eat, have sex, or indeed see anything again.</p> <p>There is actually plenty of good, normal food on TikTok. Asking around, people mention recipes for homemade crispy chilli sauce, broccoli pasta, sesame dip and various noodle dishes they\u2019ve tried, then added to their repertoire. Seema Pankhania, a 25-year-old former chef de partie at Gordon Ramsay\u2019s Lucky Cat who posts as <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@seemagetsbaked?lang=en\">@seemagetsbaked</a>, has 1.3 million followers for her eminently achievable, delicious-looking recipes. They are pleasingly lo-fi, especially her pyjama recipes for hungover, no bones days and ultra simple versions of Indian classics \u2013 her butter chicken has 1.7m likes (she also recommends her \u201c<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@seemagetsbaked/video/7165524963041086725\">super simple creamy chicken curry</a>\u201d. But even Pankhania, a proper cook, is aware it is all grist to the gnat\u2019s attention span TikTok mill. She aims to keep videos under a minute long (\u201cthe shorter the better; people are going to get bored\u201d) and has no illusions that much of the food content is only meant to be consumed with the eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole other field of cooking on TikTok which is indulgent,\u201d she says, giving the example of elaborate lasagnes. \u201cNobody is going to make it, but it\u2019s very nice and satisfying to watch.\u201d Clearly that goes for the bizarre and the gross-out stuff too in some more depraved way. \u201cAt the end of the day, social media is entertainment, right?\u201d says Pankhania. \u201cMost of it is just for entertainment and people aren\u2019t actually going to be cooking a lot of it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"867333ec298a8553dfc53cd7020d4c76450aa647\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/867333ec298a8553dfc53cd7020d4c76450aa647/0_273_8192_4918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Not terrible, but not good either\u2019 \u2026 dried \u2018fresh\u2019 pasta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Not terrible, but not good either\u2019 \u2026 dried \u2018fresh\u2019 pasta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given much of food TikTok isn\u2019t meant to be cooked, or is intentionally tongue in cheek, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing the point entirely as I cram half a packet of spaghetti into my blender.

Admittedly, there were a few issues. The steam didn\u2019t help, plus I wrapped it in too much tinfoil, so the heat couldn\u2019t penetrate. The main problem, though, was that holding an iron meant I automatically started ironing the package, pressing hard and going to and fro industriously. The result is flat, very flat. \u201cWe have a sandwich toaster,\u201d my husband points out, holding the crepe-thin delicacy between finger and thumb. He should be thrilled: this is the closest I\u2019ve come to cooking for him in months. He tries it, reluctantly. \u201cIt\u2019s very soft. Did you put mustard in it?\u201d \u201cI thought it would help,\u201d I say. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d Unless you are a particularly online person, you are probably asking why, at this point. It\u2019s a question I have asked myself repeatedly, in a rising pitch of incredulity and distress as I dived deep into TikTok food \u2013 or FoodTok, if you will. Because that is where the ironed toastie comes from: it\u2019s part of a new generation of TikTok recipe hacks that embody a provocative, frankly deranged \u201cwhy not?\u201d philosophy. We\u2019ve come a long, wrong way since 2021\u2019s viral feta pasta. Now, in addition to ironed toasties, you can enjoy a beatifically smiling blonde putting dried pasta in a blender to create an approximation of flour, then adding an egg to create a sort of dough. She then fashions lumpy, fat noodles, which she boils, tops with tomato sauce and declares \u201cexactly like fresh pasta\u201d. Comments include the likes of \u201cYOU VIOLATED THE PASTA\u201d, \u201cMa\u2019am, blink twice if someone is holding you hostage\u201d and many irate Italians. But that is not even as bad as the unholy tacos made by boiling beef, eggs and cheese in a bag of Doritos. There\u2019s a whole genre of sponsored-by-diabetes content, where beautiful, young, slim women combine terrifying quantities of marshmallows, sweets, chocolate, butter, cereal, preprepared cookie dough and the like into \u201cincredible\u201d desserts that should be illegal. Many videos are titled: \u201cWhy am I just finding out about \u2026\u201d to which the answer is surely: \u201cBecause it should be on trial at The Hague.\u201d You can watch people boil up crisps to make mashed potato, or dump uncooked dried pasta in the oven covered in a house-brick sized portion of cream cheese and a jar of sauce. Dry packet ramen oven-baked in tomato sauce and cheese is called \u201cpizza\u201d (I worry for Italy\u2019s collective blood pressure). How about marinading chicken in the sink, or massaging mountains of mac and cheese on a worktop? \u201cEverybody\u2019s so creative!\u201d TikToker @Tanaradoublechocolate, who seeks out culinary atrocities to comment upon, says. At the risk of sounding like Grampa Simpson yelling at clouds \u2013 which is exactly how I feel exploring FoodTok \u2013 what is going on? \u201cThere\u2019s a long and storied history of gross-out food on social media,\u201d says Chris Stokel-Walker, social media expert and the author of TikTok Boom. Twisted, the social media food brand that just announced a collaboration with Iceland, started out in 2016 and dared us to make the likes of deep-fried barbecue chicken-stuffed pizzadilla. Now, says Stokel-Walker, \u201cIt\u2019s been supercharged by the arrival of TikTok.\u201d The app is designed and engineered to \u201ccapture people\u2019s attention as they are scrolling through that endless feed of content\u201d and one good way to do it is precisely \u201cthe outlandish, the gross-out\u201d. It is a notion echoed by Jonah Berger, professor at the Wharton school in Pennsylvania and bestselling author of Contagious, a study of social transmission and virality, who notes that these videos combine surprise and often disgust. \u201cThe more surprising something is, the more likely we are to share it with others. And disgust is a high arousal emotion that also causes us to pass things on.\u201d So is this content engineered to provoke? Some of it, definitely. \u201cI never work to appear genuine,\u201d says Eli Betchik of @elis_kitchen, the self-proclaimed \u201cmost evil chef on TikTok\u201d. \u201cIf anyone asks, I say: \u2018Yeah, I do this for attention.\u2019 I think it\u2019s pretty obvious I do.\u201d It is a mark of Betchik\u2019s evil genius that every video of theirs makes me shout \u201cNo!\u201d in genuine anger at some point. Betchik was behind the much-reviled potato crisp mash, and a horrifying sandwich made of blended peas, pineapple, cheese and nuts, with the bread coated with mayo, then fried, among other outrages. Betchik is a fine art jeweller, who started their channel after discovering TikTok at jewellery school. \u201cI thought, I already love experimenting with food and trying new things \u2013 I could probably take that a few steps further and use it for some good old-fashioned shock-value entertainment.\u201d Their first video was fried mayonnaise. I make a strangled noise hearing this. \u201cYeah, it was horrible,\u201d confirms Betchik. Another early favourite was meatballs boiled in lime juice \u201cuntil the juice was a thick syrup. I\u2019m salivating because I can still taste the sourness. It was the most violent flavour I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Outrage is the point, and, Betchik says, people enjoy feeling it. \u201cObviously, what I\u2019m doing is to gross people out, but people keep coming back \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t keep coming back if they didn\u2019t get something out of it. I find that sometimes people get happy when they\u2019re upset in the right way.\u201d On their jewellery TikTok account @eli_metal, Betchik says, a mean comment would take days to digest, but with the food, it\u2019s a mark of success. The one comment they won\u2019t accept is that these horrendous creations are wasteful: impressively, worryingly omnivorous, Betchik finishes almost everything. In addition, \u201cI try to use foods that are close to going bad or things that have been donated to me. And if I can\u2019t eat it, I compost all the scraps.\u201d It\u2019s not clear if this level of diligence is common practice among the creators, but it feels doubtful. Mean commenters on the @myjanebrain TikTok account include a certain Gordon Ramsay, who angrily described a chicken stuffed in a pumpkin, garnished with cinnamon sticks and many onions as \u201cHalloween salmonella right there.\u201d \u201cIt was pretty awesome,\u201d says Jane, a preternaturally cheery 27-year-old Canadian and full-time content creator who prefers not to give her surname, perhaps for fear of reprisals from Italians angered by her ramen \u201cpizza\u201d. \u201cBut I know the chicken was fully cooked. It was moist, it had great flavour.\u201d Jane ended up in the realm of what is sometimes called \u201crage-bait\u201d cooking accidentally. Her early videos, she says, were straight instructional content, but she pivoted when her fried chicken recipe went viral. \u201cIt got 31m views, 3,000 comments,\u201d says Jane \u2013 this is, of course, highly populated TikTok territory, the hashtag #FoodTikTok had accumulated 112bn views by the end of 2022, for example. \u201cI thought it would be positive but it was more like: \u2018You\u2019re the worst chef I\u2019ve ever seen.\u2019 So I realised that I would have no idea what people were going to think of my videos.\u201d She started focusing on finding the \u201ccraziest combinations\u201d, including one titled \u201cI learned this hotdog trick in England\u201d, in which she makes jelly from pickle juice, adds frankfurters and eats it in a bread bun. \u201cThat is absolutely not English,\u201d I challenge her hotly, TikTok commenter style. \u201cI can\u2019t remember; it was from some sort of British something,\u201d she says. \u201cI was going to ask you why you make pickle juice jelly!\u201d What makes people angriest, though, she says, is her cooking techniques. \u201cAs soon as you cook for the internet you open yourself up to all the critics who are so specific in the way they cook.\u201d Both Jane and Eli are clear that their content is knowingly provocative rather than instructional, whether viewers understand that or not. \u201cA lot of people take this content at face value when you have to remember we\u2019re through the looking-glass on social media, where these things are being deliberately gamed for the benefit of those that create it,\u201d says Stokel-Walker. All attention is good attention, since views and shares \u2013 including the genre of angry or incredulous \u201cduet\u201d videos where other creators (including Ramsay) comment on their depravity \u2013 are the point. That\u2019s how you make money after all: successful TikTokers can become part of the app\u2019s creator fund and get paid \u2013 admittedly pennies \u2013 per view. Stokel-Walker says that success can allow creators to pivot to the kind of genuinely lucrative mainstream collaborations that Twisted has managed. There is another possibly upsetting angle: fetish. \u201cVideos where they point a lot and touch things and make super-repulsive stuff are apparently fetish,\u201d a baker friend tells me airily, when I inquire if she uses TikTok recipes.

Admittedly, there were a few issues. The steam didn\u2019t help, plus I wrapped it in too much tinfoil, so the heat couldn\u2019t penetrate. The main problem, though, was that holding an iron meant I automatically started ironing the package, pressing hard and going to and fro industriously. The result is flat, very flat. \u201cWe have a sandwich toaster,\u201d my husband points out, holding the crepe-thin delicacy between finger and thumb. He should be thrilled: this is the closest I\u2019ve come to cooking for him in months. He tries it, reluctantly. \u201cIt\u2019s very soft. Did you put mustard in it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought it would help,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5aed856f9a8245373927c3fb0c839b72846e5f97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5aed856f9a8245373927c3fb0c839b72846e5f97/0_268_8021_4815/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deranged \u2026 Emma irons her toastie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deranged \u2026 Emma irons her toastie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unless you are a particularly online person, you are probably asking why, at this point. It\u2019s a question I have asked myself repeatedly, in a rising pitch of incredulity and distress as I dived deep into TikTok food \u2013 or FoodTok, if you will. Because that is where the ironed toastie comes from: it\u2019s part of a new generation of TikTok recipe hacks that embody a provocative, frankly deranged \u201cwhy not?\u201d philosophy. We\u2019ve come a long, wrong way since <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@feelgoodfoodie/video/6922938178559069446?lang=en\">2021\u2019s viral feta pasta</a>. Now, in addition to ironed toasties, you can enjoy a beatifically smiling blonde <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@foodsfuns3/video/7209089125515939114\">putting dried pasta in a blender</a> to create an approximation of flour, then adding an egg to create a sort of dough. She then fashions lumpy, fat noodles, which she boils, tops with tomato sauce and declares \u201cexactly like fresh pasta\u201d. Comments include the likes of \u201cYOU VIOLATED THE PASTA\u201d, \u201cMa\u2019am, blink twice if someone is holding you hostage\u201d and many irate Italians.</p> <p>But that is not even as bad as the unholy tacos made by <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@myjanebrain/video/7180875279290649861\">boiling beef, eggs and cheese in a bag of Doritos</a>. There\u2019s a whole genre of sponsored-by-diabetes content, where beautiful, young, slim women combine terrifying quantities of marshmallows, sweets, chocolate, butter, cereal, preprepared cookie dough and the like into \u201cincredible\u201d desserts that should be illegal. Many videos are titled: \u201cWhy am I just finding out about \u2026\u201d to which the answer is surely: \u201cBecause it should be on trial at The Hague.\u201d You can watch people <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@elis_kitchen/video/6919198339904949509?lang=fr\">boil up crisps to make mashed potato</a>, or dump uncooked dried pasta in the oven covered in a house-brick sized portion of cream cheese and a jar of sauce. <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@myjanebrain/video/7120382043669810438\">Dry packet ramen oven-baked in tomato sauce and cheese</a> is called \u201cpizza\u201d (I worry for Italy\u2019s collective blood pressure).

Twisted, the social media food brand that just announced a collaboration with Iceland, started out in 2016 and dared us to make the likes of <a href=\"https://ffwd.medium.com/the-company-behind-that-crazy-bbq-chicken-recipe-video-would-like-to-clarify-a-few-things-32bd11dcba24\">deep-fried barbecue chicken-stuffed pizzadilla</a>. Now, says Stokel-Walker, \u201cIt\u2019s been supercharged by the arrival of TikTok.\u201d The app is designed and engineered to \u201ccapture people\u2019s attention as they are scrolling through that endless feed of content\u201d and one good way to do it is precisely \u201cthe outlandish, the gross-out\u201d. It is a notion echoed by <a href=\"https://jonahberger.com/\">Jonah Berger</a>, professor at the Wharton school in Pennsylvania and bestselling author of Contagious, a study of social transmission and virality, who notes that these videos combine surprise and often disgust. \u201cThe more surprising something is, the more likely we are to share it with others. And disgust is a high arousal emotion that also causes us to pass things on.\u201d</p> <p>So is this content engineered to provoke? Some of it, definitely. \u201cI never work to appear genuine,\u201d says Eli Betchik of <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@elis_kitchen?lang=fr\">@elis_kitchen</a>, the self-proclaimed \u201cmost evil chef on TikTok\u201d. \u201cIf anyone asks, I say: \u2018Yeah, I do this for attention.\u2019 I think it\u2019s pretty obvious I do.\u201d It is a mark of Betchik\u2019s evil genius that every video of theirs makes me shout \u201cNo!\u201d in genuine anger at some point. Betchik was behind the much-reviled potato crisp mash, and a horrifying sandwich made of blended peas, pineapple, cheese and nuts, with the bread coated with mayo, then fried, among other outrages.</p> <p>Betchik is a <a href=\"https://www.betchik.com/\">fine art jeweller</a>, who started their channel after discovering TikTok at jewellery school. \u201cI thought, I already love experimenting with food and trying new things \u2013 I could probably take that a few steps further and use it for some good old-fashioned shock-value entertainment.\u201d Their first video was fried mayonnaise. I make a strangled noise hearing this. \u201cYeah, it was horrible,\u201d confirms Betchik. Another early favourite was meatballs boiled in lime juice \u201cuntil the juice was a thick syrup. I\u2019m salivating because I can still taste the sourness. It was the most violent flavour I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7b83a7936e8ebf4bcc6df3fe2a34933eb8e1b240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b83a7936e8ebf4bcc6df3fe2a34933eb8e1b240/23_156_722_940/384.jpg\" alt=\"Evil \u2026 @elis_kitchen\u2019s pea, pineapple, nuts and cheese sandwich fried in mayonnaise.\" width=\"384\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Evil \u2026 @elis_kitchen\u2019s pea, pineapple, nuts and cheese sandwich fried in mayonnaise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @elis_kitchen/Tik Tok</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Outrage is the point, and, Betchik says, people enjoy feeling it. \u201cObviously, what I\u2019m doing is to gross people out, but people keep coming back \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t keep coming back if they didn\u2019t get something out of it. I find that sometimes people get happy when they\u2019re upset in the right way.\u201d On their jewellery TikTok account <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@eli_metal?lang=en\">@eli_metal</a>, Betchik says, a mean comment would take days to digest, but with the food, it\u2019s a mark of success. The one comment they won\u2019t accept is that these horrendous creations are wasteful: impressively, worryingly omnivorous, Betchik finishes almost everything. In addition, \u201cI try to use foods that are close to going bad or things that have been donated to me. And if I can\u2019t eat it, I compost all the scraps.\u201d It\u2019s not clear if this level of diligence is common practice among the creators, but it feels doubtful.</p> <p>Mean commenters on the <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@myjanebrain?lang=en\">@myjanebrain</a> TikTok account include a certain Gordon Ramsay, who angrily described a chicken stuffed in a pumpkin, garnished with cinnamon sticks and many onions as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@gordonramsayofficial/video/7159989070607748357?lang=en\">Halloween salmonella right there</a>.\u201d \u201cIt was pretty awesome,\u201d says Jane, a preternaturally cheery 27-year-old Canadian and full-time content creator who prefers not to give her surname, perhaps for fear of reprisals from Italians angered by her ramen \u201cpizza\u201d. \u201cBut I know the chicken was fully cooked. It was moist, it had great flavour.\u201d</p> <p>Jane ended up in the realm of what is sometimes called \u201crage-bait\u201d cooking accidentally. Her early videos, she says, were straight instructional content, but she pivoted when her fried chicken recipe went viral. \u201cIt got 31m views, 3,000 comments,\u201d says Jane \u2013 this is, of course, highly populated TikTok territory, the hashtag #FoodTikTok had accumulated 112bn views by the end of 2022, for example. \u201cI thought it would be positive but it was more like: \u2018You\u2019re the worst chef I\u2019ve ever seen.\u2019 So I realised that I would have no idea what people were going to think of my videos.\u201d</p> <p>She started focusing on finding the \u201ccraziest combinations\u201d, including one titled \u201cI learned this hotdog trick in England\u201d, in which she makes jelly from pickle juice, adds frankfurters and eats it in a bread bun. \u201cThat is absolutely not English,\u201d I challenge her hotly, TikTok commenter style. \u201cI can\u2019t remember; it was from some sort of British something,\u201d she says. \u201cI was going to ask you why you make pickle juice jelly!\u201d What makes people angriest, though, she says, is her cooking techniques. \u201cAs soon as you cook for the internet you open yourself up to all the critics who are so specific in the way they cook.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c681fee56db350006914e45c1dfc969e70f6ff71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c681fee56db350006914e45c1dfc969e70f6ff71/0_0_2006_1658/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ramsay baiting \u2026 @myjanebrain makes chicken in a pumpkin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"827\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ramsay baiting \u2026 @myjanebrain makes chicken in a pumpkin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amyjanebrain, @gordonramsayofficial/Tik Tok</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both Jane and Eli are clear that their content is knowingly provocative rather than instructional, whether viewers understand that or not. \u201cA lot of people take this content at face value when you have to remember we\u2019re through the looking-glass on social media, where these things are being deliberately gamed for the benefit of those that create it,\u201d says Stokel-Walker. All attention is good attention, since views and shares \u2013 including the genre of angry or incredulous \u201cduet\u201d videos where other creators (including Ramsay) comment on their depravity \u2013 are the point. That\u2019s how you make money after all: successful TikTokers can become part of the app\u2019s creator fund and get paid \u2013 admittedly pennies \u2013 per view. Stokel-Walker says that success can allow creators to pivot to the kind of genuinely lucrative mainstream <a href=\"https://retailtimes.co.uk/twisted-announces-a-new-frozen-food-collaboration-with-iceland-designed-to-make-eating-as-fun-and-social-as-possible/\">collaborations that Twisted has managed</a>.</p> <p>There is another possibly upsetting angle: fetish. \u201cVideos where they point a lot and touch things and make super-repulsive stuff are apparently fetish,\u201d a baker friend tells me airily, when I inquire if she uses TikTok recipes. It turns out there\u2019s a fairly widespread suspicion this is a thing. The messier foods could fulfil a \u201csploshing\u201d fetish: <a href=\"https://www.insidehook.com/article/internet/gross-viral-food-hacks-rick-lax-facebook-sploshing-fetish\">getting sexual gratification from food mess</a>. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this aired,\u201d says Stokel-Walker. \u201cCertainly, it appeals to your senses. It\u2019s like a slow-motion car crash in food form, where you\u2019re like, how more disgusting can this get?\u201d TikTok user <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lenarae.lh?lang=en\">@lenarae.lh</a> analyses food videos and pronounces them fetish or non-fetish on the basis of how the women \u2013 it is almost always women \u2013 use their hands, splash or squirt stuff suggestively or massage phallic things. A friend also directs me to the work of a creator called <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cedriklorenzen?lang=en\">@cedriklorenzen</a> who specialises in whacking pieces of raw meat, dribbling, drizzling and taking his top off. It\u2019s a better appetite suppressant than Ozempic: after watching, I never want to eat, have sex, or indeed see anything again.</p> <p>There is actually plenty of good, normal food on TikTok. Asking around, people mention recipes for homemade crispy chilli sauce, broccoli pasta, sesame dip and various noodle dishes they\u2019ve tried, then added to their repertoire. Seema Pankhania, a 25-year-old former chef de partie at Gordon Ramsay\u2019s Lucky Cat who posts as <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@seemagetsbaked?lang=en\">@seemagetsbaked</a>, has 1.3 million followers for her eminently achievable, delicious-looking recipes. They are pleasingly lo-fi, especially her pyjama recipes for hungover, no bones days and ultra simple versions of Indian classics \u2013 her butter chicken has 1.7m likes (she also recommends her \u201c<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@seemagetsbaked/video/7165524963041086725\">super simple creamy chicken curry</a>\u201d. But even Pankhania, a proper cook, is aware it is all grist to the gnat\u2019s attention span TikTok mill. She aims to keep videos under a minute long (\u201cthe shorter the better; people are going to get bored\u201d) and has no illusions that much of the food content is only meant to be consumed with the eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole other field of cooking on TikTok which is indulgent,\u201d she says, giving the example of elaborate lasagnes. \u201cNobody is going to make it, but it\u2019s very nice and satisfying to watch.\u201d Clearly that goes for the bizarre and the gross-out stuff too in some more depraved way. \u201cAt the end of the day, social media is entertainment, right?\u201d says Pankhania. \u201cMost of it is just for entertainment and people aren\u2019t actually going to be cooking a lot of it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"867333ec298a8553dfc53cd7020d4c76450aa647\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/867333ec298a8553dfc53cd7020d4c76450aa647/0_273_8192_4918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Not terrible, but not good either\u2019 \u2026 dried \u2018fresh\u2019 pasta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Not terrible, but not good either\u2019 \u2026 dried \u2018fresh\u2019 pasta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given much of food TikTok isn\u2019t meant to be cooked, or is intentionally tongue in cheek, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing the point entirely as I cram half a packet of spaghetti into my blender. A flimsy thing, it protests loudly with an ominous smell of burning rubber. I whiz up vermicelli instead, dump the \u201cflour\u201d on the worktop and add an egg, making a claggy mess.

Admittedly, there were a few issues. The steam didn\u2019t help, plus I wrapped it in too much tinfoil, so the heat couldn\u2019t penetrate. The main problem, though, was that holding an iron meant I automatically started ironing the package, pressing hard and going to and fro industriously. The result is flat, very flat. \u201cWe have a sandwich toaster,\u201d my husband points out, holding the crepe-thin delicacy between finger and thumb. He should be thrilled: this is the closest I\u2019ve come to cooking for him in months. He tries it, reluctantly. \u201cIt\u2019s very soft. Did you put mustard in it?\u201d \u201cI thought it would help,\u201d I say. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nUnless you are a particularly online person, you are probably asking why, at this point. It\u2019s a question I have asked myself repeatedly, in a rising pitch of incredulity and distress as I dived deep into TikTok food \u2013 or FoodTok, if you will. Because that is where the ironed toastie comes from: it\u2019s part of a new generation of TikTok recipe hacks that embody a provocative, frankly deranged \u201cwhy not?\u201d philosophy. We\u2019ve come a long, wrong way since 2021\u2019s viral feta pasta. Now, in addition to ironed toasties, you can enjoy a beatifically smiling blonde putting dried pasta in a blender to create an approximation of flour, then adding an egg to create a sort of dough. She then fashions lumpy, fat noodles, which she boils, tops with tomato sauce and declares \u201cexactly like fresh pasta\u201d. Comments include the likes of \u201cYOU VIOLATED THE PASTA\u201d, \u201cMa\u2019am, blink twice if someone is holding you hostage\u201d and many irate Italians. But that is not even as bad as the unholy tacos made by boiling beef, eggs and cheese in a bag of Doritos. There\u2019s a whole genre of sponsored-by-diabetes content, where beautiful, young, slim women combine terrifying quantities of marshmallows, sweets, chocolate, butter, cereal, preprepared cookie dough and the like into \u201cincredible\u201d desserts that should be illegal. Many videos are titled: \u201cWhy am I just finding out about \u2026\u201d to which the answer is surely: \u201cBecause it should be on trial at The Hague.\u201d You can watch people boil up crisps to make mashed potato, or dump uncooked dried pasta in the oven covered in a house-brick sized portion of cream cheese and a jar of sauce. Dry packet ramen oven-baked in tomato sauce and cheese is called \u201cpizza\u201d (I worry for Italy\u2019s collective blood pressure). How about marinading chicken in the sink, or massaging mountains of mac and cheese on a worktop? \u201cEverybody\u2019s so creative!\u201d TikToker @Tanaradoublechocolate, who seeks out culinary atrocities to comment upon, says.\nAt the risk of sounding like Grampa Simpson yelling at clouds \u2013 which is exactly how I feel exploring FoodTok \u2013 what is going on? \u201cThere\u2019s a long and storied history of gross-out food on social media,\u201d says Chris Stokel-Walker, social media expert and the author of TikTok Boom. Twisted, the social media food brand that just announced a collaboration with Iceland, started out in 2016 and dared us to make the likes of deep-fried barbecue chicken-stuffed pizzadilla. Now, says Stokel-Walker, \u201cIt\u2019s been supercharged by the arrival of TikTok.\u201d The app is designed and engineered to \u201ccapture people\u2019s attention as they are scrolling through that endless feed of content\u201d and one good way to do it is precisely \u201cthe outlandish, the gross-out\u201d. It is a notion echoed by Jonah Berger, professor at the Wharton school in Pennsylvania and bestselling author of Contagious, a study of social transmission and virality, who notes that these videos combine surprise and often disgust. \u201cThe more surprising something is, the more likely we are to share it with others. And disgust is a high arousal emotion that also causes us to pass things on.\u201d So is this content engineered to provoke? Some of it, definitely. \u201cI never work to appear genuine,\u201d says Eli Betchik of @elis_kitchen, the self-proclaimed \u201cmost evil chef on TikTok\u201d. \u201cIf anyone asks, I say: \u2018Yeah, I do this for attention.\u2019 I think it\u2019s pretty obvious I do.\u201d It is a mark of Betchik\u2019s evil genius that every video of theirs makes me shout \u201cNo!\u201d in genuine anger at some point. Betchik was behind the much-reviled potato crisp mash, and a horrifying sandwich made of blended peas, pineapple, cheese and nuts, with the bread coated with mayo, then fried, among other outrages. Betchik is a fine art jeweller, who started their channel after discovering TikTok at jewellery school. \u201cI thought, I already love experimenting with food and trying new things \u2013 I could probably take that a few steps further and use it for some good old-fashioned shock-value entertainment.\u201d Their first video was fried mayonnaise. I make a strangled noise hearing this. \u201cYeah, it was horrible,\u201d confirms Betchik. Another early favourite was meatballs boiled in lime juice \u201cuntil the juice was a thick syrup. I\u2019m salivating because I can still taste the sourness. It was the most violent flavour I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\nOutrage is the point, and, Betchik says, people enjoy feeling it. \u201cObviously, what I\u2019m doing is to gross people out, but people keep coming back \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t keep coming back if they didn\u2019t get something out of it. I find that sometimes people get happy when they\u2019re upset in the right way.\u201d On their jewellery TikTok account @eli_metal, Betchik says, a mean comment would take days to digest, but with the food, it\u2019s a mark of success. The one comment they won\u2019t accept is that these horrendous creations are wasteful: impressively, worryingly omnivorous, Betchik finishes almost everything. In addition, \u201cI try to use foods that are close to going bad or things that have been donated to me. And if I can\u2019t eat it, I compost all the scraps.\u201d It\u2019s not clear if this level of diligence is common practice among the creators, but it feels doubtful. Mean commenters on the @myjanebrain TikTok account include a certain Gordon Ramsay, who angrily described a chicken stuffed in a pumpkin, garnished with cinnamon sticks and many onions as \u201cHalloween salmonella right there.\u201d \u201cIt was pretty awesome,\u201d says Jane, a preternaturally cheery 27-year-old Canadian and full-time content creator who prefers not to give her surname, perhaps for fear of reprisals from Italians angered by her ramen \u201cpizza\u201d. \u201cBut I know the chicken was fully cooked. It was moist, it had great flavour.\u201d Jane ended up in the realm of what is sometimes called \u201crage-bait\u201d cooking accidentally. Her early videos, she says, were straight instructional content, but she pivoted when her fried chicken recipe went viral. \u201cIt got 31m views, 3,000 comments,\u201d says Jane \u2013 this is, of course, highly populated TikTok territory, the hashtag #FoodTikTok had accumulated 112bn views by the end of 2022, for example. \u201cI thought it would be positive but it was more like: \u2018You\u2019re the worst chef I\u2019ve ever seen.\u2019 So I realised that I would have no idea what people were going to think of my videos.\u201d She started focusing on finding the \u201ccraziest combinations\u201d, including one titled \u201cI learned this hotdog trick in England\u201d, in which she makes jelly from pickle juice, adds frankfurters and eats it in a bread bun. \u201cThat is absolutely not English,\u201d I challenge her hotly, TikTok commenter style. \u201cI can\u2019t remember; it was from some sort of British something,\u201d she says. \u201cI was going to ask you why you make pickle juice jelly!\u201d What makes people angriest, though, she says, is her cooking techniques. \u201cAs soon as you cook for the internet you open yourself up to all the critics who are so specific in the way they cook.\u201d\nBoth Jane and Eli are clear that their content is knowingly provocative rather than instructional, whether viewers understand that or not. \u201cA lot of people take this content at face value when you have to remember we\u2019re through the looking-glass on social media, where these things are being deliberately gamed for the benefit of those that create it,\u201d says Stokel-Walker. All attention is good attention, since views and shares \u2013 including the genre of angry or incredulous \u201cduet\u201d videos where other creators (including Ramsay) comment on their depravity \u2013 are the point. That\u2019s how you make money after all: successful TikTokers can become part of the app\u2019s creator fund and get paid \u2013 admittedly pennies \u2013 per view. Stokel-Walker says that success can allow creators to pivot to the kind of genuinely lucrative mainstream collaborations that Twisted has managed. There is another possibly upsetting angle: fetish. \u201cVideos where they point a lot and touch things and make super-repulsive stuff are apparently fetish,\u201d a baker friend tells me airily, when I inquire if she uses TikTok recipes. It turns out there\u2019s a fairly widespread suspicion this is a thing. The messier foods could fulfil a \u201csploshing\u201d fetish: getting sexual gratification from food mess. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this aired,\u201d says Stokel-Walker. \u201cCertainly, it appeals to your senses. It\u2019s like a slow-motion car crash in food form, where you\u2019re like, how more disgusting can this get?\u201d TikTok user @lenarae.lh analyses food videos and pronounces them fetish or non-fetish on the basis of how the women \u2013 it is almost always women \u2013 use their hands, splash or squirt stuff suggestively or massage phallic things. A friend also directs me to the work of a creator called @cedriklorenzen who specialises in whacking pieces of raw meat, dribbling, drizzling and taking his top off. It\u2019s a better appetite suppressant than Ozempic: after watching, I never want to eat, have sex, or indeed see anything again. There is actually plenty of good, normal food on TikTok. Asking around, people mention recipes for homemade crispy chilli sauce, broccoli pasta, sesame dip and various noodle dishes they\u2019ve tried, then added to their repertoire. Seema Pankhania, a 25-year-old former chef de partie at Gordon Ramsay\u2019s Lucky Cat who posts as @seemagetsbaked, has 1.3 million followers for her eminently achievable, delicious-looking recipes. They are pleasingly lo-fi, especially her pyjama recipes for hungover, no bones days and ultra simple versions of Indian classics \u2013 her butter chicken has 1.7m likes (she also recommends her \u201csuper simple creamy chicken curry\u201d. But even Pankhania, a proper cook, is aware it is all grist to the gnat\u2019s attention span TikTok mill. She aims to keep videos under a minute long (\u201cthe shorter the better; people are going to get bored\u201d) and has no illusions that much of the food content is only meant to be consumed with the eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole other field of cooking on TikTok which is indulgent,\u201d she says, giving the example of elaborate lasagnes. \u201cNobody is going to make it, but it\u2019s very nice and satisfying to watch.\u201d Clearly that goes for the bizarre and the gross-out stuff too in some more depraved way. \u201cAt the end of the day, social media is entertainment, right?\u201d says Pankhania. \u201cMost of it is just for entertainment and people aren\u2019t actually going to be cooking a lot of it.\u201d\nGiven much of food TikTok isn\u2019t meant to be cooked, or is intentionally tongue in cheek, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing the point entirely as I cram half a packet of spaghetti into my blender. A flimsy thing, it protests loudly with an ominous smell of burning rubber. I whiz up vermicelli instead, dump the \u201cflour\u201d on the worktop and add an egg, making a claggy mess. I have to add normal flour \u2013 surely invalidating the whole madness \u2013 to form a dough ball capable of being rolled out. The resultant approximate noodles are dumped in boiling water. I take them out based on vibes alone \u2013 TikTok recipes are wildly unspecific \u2013 then my family gather to taste and criticise.

A friend also directs me to the work of a creator called <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cedriklorenzen?lang=en\">@cedriklorenzen</a> who specialises in whacking pieces of raw meat, dribbling, drizzling and taking his top off. It\u2019s a better appetite suppressant than Ozempic: after watching, I never want to eat, have sex, or indeed see anything again.</p> \n<p>There is actually plenty of good, normal food on TikTok. Asking around, people mention recipes for homemade crispy chilli sauce, broccoli pasta, sesame dip and various noodle dishes they\u2019ve tried, then added to their repertoire. Seema Pankhania, a 25-year-old former chef de partie at Gordon Ramsay\u2019s Lucky Cat who posts as <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@seemagetsbaked?lang=en\">@seemagetsbaked</a>, has 1.3 million followers for her eminently achievable, delicious-looking recipes. They are pleasingly lo-fi, especially her pyjama recipes for hungover, no bones days and ultra simple versions of Indian classics \u2013 her butter chicken has 1.7m likes (she also recommends her \u201c<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@seemagetsbaked/video/7165524963041086725\">super simple creamy chicken curry</a>\u201d.

She aims to keep videos under a minute long (\u201cthe shorter the better; people are going to get bored\u201d) and has no illusions that much of the food content is only meant to be consumed with the eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole other field of cooking on TikTok which is indulgent,\u201d she says, giving the example of elaborate lasagnes. \u201cNobody is going to make it, but it\u2019s very nice and satisfying to watch.\u201d Clearly that goes for the bizarre and the gross-out stuff too in some more depraved way. \u201cAt the end of the day, social media is entertainment, right?\u201d says Pankhania. \u201cMost of it is just for entertainment and people aren\u2019t actually going to be cooking a lot of it.\u201d</p>"}}, {"type": "image", "assets": [{"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/867333ec298a8553dfc53cd7020d4c76450aa647/0_273_8192_4918/8192.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 8192, "height": 4918}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/867333ec298a8553dfc53cd7020d4c76450aa647/0_273_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 8192, "height": 4918, "isMaster": true}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/867333ec298a8553dfc53cd7020d4c76450aa647/0_273_8192_4918/2000.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 2000, "height": 1200}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/867333ec298a8553dfc53cd7020d4c76450aa647/0_273_8192_4918/1000.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 1000, "height": 600}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/867333ec298a8553dfc53cd7020d4c76450aa647/0_273_8192_4918/500.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 500, "height": 300}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/867333ec298a8553dfc53cd7020d4c76450aa647/0_273_8192_4918/140.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 140, "height": 84}}], "imageTypeData": {"caption": "\u2018Not terrible, but not good either\u2019 \u2026 dried \u2018fresh\u2019 pasta.", "displayCredit": true, "credit": "Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian", "source": "The Guardian", "photographer": "Christopher Thomond", "alt": "\u2018Not terrible, but not good either\u2019 \u2026 dried \u2018fresh\u2019 pasta.", "mediaId": "867333ec298a8553dfc53cd7020d4c76450aa647", "mediaApiUri": "https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/867333ec298a8553dfc53cd7020d4c76450aa647", "imageType": "Photograph"}}, {"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>Given much of food TikTok isn\u2019t meant to be cooked, or is intentionally tongue in cheek, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing the point entirely as I cram half a packet of spaghetti into my blender.

The incident on Monday prompted a direct warning from Blinken, who separately telephoned the RSF leader Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, and Sudan\u2019s army chief, Gen Abdel Fatah al-Burhan, to tell them any danger posed to American diplomats was unacceptable. Blinken said the convoy that came under fire was flying US. flags and all in the convoy were safe. \u201cWe have deep concerns about the overall security environment,\u201d he said at a press conference in Japan where he attended a G7 meeting of foreign ministers. Fighting erupted on Saturday between army units loyal to Burhan, the head of Sudan\u2019s transitional governing Sovereign Council, and Hemedti, the deputy head of the council. The UN envoy to Sudan says at least 185 people have been killed and more than 1,800 wounded. Many more bodies lay uncollected in the streets. A US state department official said Blinken had expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d over civilian deaths in his calls with the rival leaders, and urged them to agree to a ceasefire. Both had a responsibility to \u201censure the safety and wellbeing of civilians, diplomatic personnel, and humanitarian workers\u201d, the official said. Hemedti said he had discussed \u201cpressing issues\u201d with Blinken during their call and further talks were planned. \u201cWe will have another call to continuing dialogue and working hand-in-hand to forge a brighter future for our nations,\u201d tweeted Hemedti, whose whereabouts have not been disclosed since the fighting began. Sudan\u2019s rival factions both claimed to have made gains on Monday as violence cut power and water in the capital. Volker Perthes, the UN envoy to Sudan, said the two sides showed no signs of being willing to negotiate. The power struggle has derailed a shift to civilian rule and raised fears of a wider conflict. Clashes in Khartoum have centred on key sites such as the international airport, presidential palace and the army headquarters. In comments to Sky News, Burhan said he was secure in a presidential guesthouse within the defence ministry compound. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said the EU ambassador in Khartoum had been assaulted at his residency. Borrell did not say if the ambassador, the Irish diplomat Aidan O\u2019Hara, had been badly injured, but called the attack \u201ca gross violation of the Vienna convention\u201d, which is supposed to guarantee the protection of diplomatic premises. The US national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said the US was not, for the time being, planning an evacuation from the country. Burhan raised the stakes in the violence still further on Monday, ordering the dissolution of the RSF, which he called a \u201crebellious group\u201d. For his part, Hemedti called Burhan \u201ca radical Islamist who is bombing civilians from the air\u201d. Military jets flew low over the capital through much of Monday as repeated bouts of firing and shelling continued there and in Omdurman, Khartoum\u2019s sister city across the Nile. Witnesses have reported dozens of bodies in one central neighbourhood of the capital, and hundreds of students remain trapped in schools by the fighting. Hospitals have been particularly affected, with essential supplies badly disrupted by the fighting. Hundreds of patients have been evacuated, while medical staff attempt to move others from intensive care or dialysis units to places of safety. \u201cWe had to move them to the isolation centres along with 70 doctors and nurses, all have been trapped here with no oxygen for the chest patients and that\u2019s really dangerous \u2026 The oxygen we have is from the time of the pandemic and it\u2019s limited,\u201d one nurse said. Aid workers in remote parts of Sudan also reported tensions or violence. One based in on the eastern border with Ethiopia described the regular army overwhelming a small RSF contingent and seizing their base amid sporadic shooting. Officials also reported fighting in the east, including the provinces of Kassala and El Gadaref. The conflict threatens to plunge one of Africa\u2019s biggest and most strategically important countries into chaos. Analysts say only pressure from \u201cheavyweight\u201d intermediaries will have a chance of ending the fighting. In a speech broadcast by Egyptian state television late on Monday, President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi said he was in regular contact with the army and RSF to \u201cencourage them to accept a ceasefire and spare the blood of the Sudanese people\u201d. The African Union\u2019s top council has called for an immediate ceasefire without conditions, while other Arab states with stakes in Sudan \u2013 Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 made similar appeals.

Hundreds of patients have been evacuated, while medical staff attempt to move others from intensive care or dialysis units to places of safety. \u201cWe had to move them to the isolation centres along with 70 doctors and nurses, all have been trapped here with no oxygen for the chest patients and that\u2019s really dangerous \u2026 The oxygen we have is from the time of the pandemic and it\u2019s limited,\u201d one nurse said.\nAid workers in remote parts of Sudan also reported tensions or violence. One based in on the eastern border with Ethiopia described the regular army overwhelming a small RSF contingent and seizing their base amid sporadic shooting. Officials also reported fighting in the east, including the provinces of Kassala and El Gadaref. The conflict threatens to plunge one of Africa\u2019s biggest and most strategically important countries into chaos. Analysts say only pressure from \u201cheavyweight\u201d intermediaries will have a chance of ending the fighting.\nIn a speech broadcast by Egyptian state television late on Monday, President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi said he was in regular contact with the army and RSF to \u201cencourage them to accept a ceasefire and spare the blood of the Sudanese people\u201d. The African Union\u2019s top council has called for an immediate ceasefire without conditions, while other Arab states with stakes in Sudan \u2013 Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 made similar appeals.

After more than two years of turmoil following the 2021 military coup, hundreds of locals from neighbouring villages had been invited to Pa Zi Gyi to celebrate the opening of a new village hall, which had been set up by the junta\u2019s domestic opponents. Families \u2013 from young toddlers and pregnant women to grandparents \u2013 had set off early to attend. The gathering on 11 April quickly became the scene of the deadliest airstrike by the Myanmar military since it seized power; 168 people, including 40 children and 24 pregnant women, were killed, according to the national unity government (NUG), which was set up by elected politicians and activists to oppose the military. The attack began at 7.30am, when a military jet fighter bombed the area. Shortly afterwards, a helicopter gunship opened fire, according to the NUG.

The airstrike came just days ahead of Thingyan, the Burmese new year festival, normally a time of celebrations and splashing water in the streets.

Thurein, a 29-year-old resident of Yangon\u2019s Mingalar Taungnyunt township, said the streets near to him were deserted. \u201cWe used to go to big pavilions and party with our friends. Now our country is sick, and there is nothing to celebrate,\u201d he said. The attack in Pa Zi Gyi was widely condemned, including by the US and the EU. However, activists say the international community has failed to take meaningful action. Montse Ferrer, Amnesty International\u2019s researcher and adviser on business and human rights, said that while some countries had imposed sanctions aimed at stopping jet fuel reaching the military, these generally targeted individual companies \u2013 something the military can easily evade. \u201cA company that today is called \u2018X\u2019, tomorrow is called \u2018Y\u2019 and the sanction in many ways is no longer effective,\u201d said Ferrer, who added that wider, sectoral sanctions were needed. Only Canada has taken this step. Days after the attack at Pa Zi Gyi, the village stands deserted. Funerals for the victims, including Soe Naing\u2019s relatives, have not yet been held because most of the residents worry about further military violence. \u201cTruthfully, no human being would engage in such a heinous act,\u201d said Soe Naing. \u201cThey were not born as human beings.\u201d *Name has been changed for security reasons", "attributes": {}, "published": true, "createdDate": "2023-04-18T04:00:34Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-04-17T12:55:21Z", "contributors": [], "elements": [{"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>It was supposed to be an opportunity for local people to gather and share food.

Karen Andrews from shadow cabinet necessitated a wider reshuffle, but Peter Dutton has taken to the task with all the subtlety of the proverbial sledgehammer to a walnut.</p> <p>When Julian Leeser announced his departure from the frontbench last week to campaign in favour of the Indigenous voice, it immediately put the Coalition\u2019s two Indigenous senators \u2013 Jacinta Price and Kerrynne Liddle \u2013 in the frame for promotion.</p> <p>Although both are first-term senators, the Coalition could benefit from their experience throughout the voice referendum debate, in which both are

Indigenous voice, Peter Dutton provides the yes campaign with a ready-made villain | Peter Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In elevating Price to the shadow minister role, parachuting her straight into cabinet, Dutton has opted for a high-risk strategy of maximising the Coalition\u2019s brand differentiation with Labor and locking in hard against the voice.</p> <p>Perhaps it should be unsurprising that in a reshuffle sparked by taking the middle-of-the-road option of a free vote off the table, Dutton has doubled down by promoting a strident opponent of the voice all the way into shadow cabinet.</p> <p>Price got to work early, attacking the referendum proposal which she said some Indigenous communities felt was being pushed by \u201cthose who have long-held positions within the Aboriginal industry\u201d.</p> <p>Price declared it was \u201cutterly ridiculous\u201d that in South Australia people \u201ccan write a statutory declaration and claim to be Indigenous\u201d and have input into that state\u2019s voice, adding this was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d.</p> <p>The other remarkable aspect of Price\u2019s promotion is that she is the seventh National in cabinet \u2013 one more than the quota guarantees the junior member of the Coalition.

Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads The Nationals\u2019 influence is expanding not because their numbers in the Coalition party room require it \u2013 in fact, they lost an MP, Andrew Gee, over the voice in December. Rather, it is because Dutton\u2019s conservatism puts him naturally closer on social issues to their regions-first ideology than to Liberal moderates within his own party. After the Aston byelection defeat, Dutton declared that the Coalition is \u201cthe party of regional and rural Australia\u201d and that too much of Labor\u2019s effort is \u201cconcentrated on capital cities\u201d. On Tuesday Dutton said he wants his \u201cbest people on the paddock\u201d and it would be \u201csilly to overlook [Price\u2019s] obvious talent\u201d because of a quota. Reasonable minds can differ about the merit of a candidate for any job \u2013 and in the context of a reshuffle \u201cobvious talent\u201d can just mean whoever suits the leader most. Littleproud said Price\u2019s promotion means that women hold 60% of the party\u2019s shadow cabinet positions. He praised the \u201cdiversity\u201d, experience and \u201ccommonsense\u201d the party brings to Canberra. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the Nationals representing a particular constituency, but the non-Labor side of politics in Australia has succeeded over many decades because it combines the strength of the conservative and liberal political tendencies. But liberals are increasingly finding a home elsewhere: with the teal independents in the seven inner-city seats they now hold; or with Labor, which won blue-ribbon seats such as Higgins, Bennelong and now Aston; or the Greens, who won Ryan and Brisbane from the Liberals. Who is left to represent the experience of the parts of the country the Coalition needs to win to get back in government? A rump of moderates who spoke in favour of a free vote on the voice in shadow cabinet and a few more committed advocates including MP Bridget Archer and Senator Andrew Bragg. Price may speak for some Indigenous people who feel the voice will make little practical difference, but public opinion polling and the consensus in the Uluru statement from the heart would suggest this is a minority view. By deriding those who disagree with her as the \u201cAboriginal industry\u201d, Price is hardly the model of good faith that opponents of the voice, including Dutton, say must be a feature of the debate. Dutton continues to go all-in on the Sky after dark strategy that the Coalition must first shift right to rebuild its base to achieve electoral success \u2013 in this case elevating the voice\u2019s most strident critic.", "charCount": "4695", "shouldHideReaderRevenue": "false", "showAffiliateLinks": "false", "bylineHtml": "<a href=\"profile/paul-karp\">Paul Karp</a>", "showTableOfContents": "false"}, "tags": [{"id": "australia-news/indigenous-voice-to-parliament", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "australia-news", "sectionName": "Australia news", "webTitle": "Indigenous voice to parliament", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/indigenous-voice-to-parliament", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/indigenous-voice-to-parliament", "references": [], "description": "<p>News, opinion and the latest updates on the proposed voice to Australia's parliament.

Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads The Nationals\u2019 influence is expanding not because their numbers in the Coalition party room require it \u2013 in fact, they lost an MP, Andrew Gee, over the voice in December. Rather, it is because Dutton\u2019s conservatism puts him naturally closer on social issues to their regions-first ideology than to Liberal moderates within his own party. After the Aston byelection defeat, Dutton declared that the Coalition is \u201cthe party of regional and rural Australia\u201d and that too much of Labor\u2019s effort is \u201cconcentrated on capital cities\u201d. On Tuesday Dutton said he wants his \u201cbest people on the paddock\u201d and it would be \u201csilly to overlook [Price\u2019s] obvious talent\u201d because of a quota. Reasonable minds can differ about the merit of a candidate for any job \u2013 and in the context of a reshuffle \u201cobvious talent\u201d can just mean whoever suits the leader most.\nLittleproud said Price\u2019s promotion means that women hold 60% of the party\u2019s shadow cabinet positions. He praised the \u201cdiversity\u201d, experience and \u201ccommonsense\u201d the party brings to Canberra. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the Nationals representing a particular constituency, but the non-Labor side of politics in Australia has succeeded over many decades because it combines the strength of the conservative and liberal political tendencies. But liberals are increasingly finding a home elsewhere: with the teal independents in the seven inner-city seats they now hold; or with Labor, which won blue-ribbon seats such as Higgins, Bennelong and now Aston; or the Greens, who won Ryan and Brisbane from the Liberals. Who is left to represent the experience of the parts of the country the Coalition needs to win to get back in government? A rump of moderates who spoke in favour of a free vote on the voice in shadow cabinet and a few more committed advocates including MP Bridget Archer and Senator Andrew Bragg. Price may speak for some Indigenous people who feel the voice will make little practical difference, but public opinion polling and the consensus in the Uluru statement from the heart would suggest this is a minority view. By deriding those who disagree with her as the \u201cAboriginal industry\u201d, Price is hardly the model of good faith that opponents of the voice, including Dutton, say must be a feature of the debate.

Purcell and other Narrabri residents were concerned the rail would exacerbate the risk from flooding. When their concerns were put to the then infrastructure minister Barnaby Joyce, he said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/what-the-hell-were-you-thinking-fighting-flares-in-narrabri-over-inland-rail\">consideration of alternative routes would take too long</a>.</p> <h2>What will it carry?</h2> <p>According to Schott, by 2050, 70% of the freight to be carried on Inland Rail will be for domestic use, including household goods and groceries produced in Australia and consumed in our major cities.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2015-08/apo-nid220986_1.pdf\">2015 business case</a> prepared by the former Nationals leader John Anderson estimated that \u201cover half of the total demand for Inland Rail by volume\u201d would come from coal. </p> <p>There is not a lot of other information in the public realm about who the freight customers will be and how the goods will move, except that they have to make the journey in 24 hours to compete against the trucking industry. </p> <h2>Is it economically and environmentally sound?</h2> <p>One of the selling points of the project is to ease traffic congestion around east coast cities and lower transport emissions. <a href=\"https://www.inlandrail.gov.au/understanding-inland-rail/why-inland-rail/environment\">Government</a> forecasts say that by 2050 the inland rail will cut carbon emissions by 750,000 tonnes a year and reduce the number of trucks on the road by 200,000. </p> <p>But Schott notes both the inland rail project and the operating business of ARTC are facing more pressing challenges. ARTC currently relies heavily on transporting coal \u2013 according to <a href=\"https://www.artc.com.au/uploads/ARTC-Annual-Report-2021-2022.pdf\">its 2021-22 annual report</a>, 63% of its revenue related to the coal industry.</p> <p>In that same report, ARTC is hoping markets developed around the inland rail will \u201calso reduce the risks associated with declining coal production\u201d.</p> <p>So the business case for the inland rail relied on the transport of coal but ARTC is relying on it to generate revenue to make up for the decline of the coal industry. The project may be as much a lifeline for the ARTC economically as it was for the National party politically.</p> <h2>Can we do big infrastructure projects as a country?</h2> <p>Anyone who has completed the smallest building task in the last few years knows building costs have blown out. The inland rail is just the latest in a long list of blowouts, the latest being the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/13/nsw-government-launches-sydney-metro-review-amid-21bn-cost-blowout\">Sydney Metro program</a>.</p> <p>Big infrastructure projects, many of them related to transport, are <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/warning-that-more-mega-projects-will-run-late-over-budget-20221213-p5c5x1.html\">increasingly crimped</a> by a mix of labour shortages, rising construction material costs and a concentration of projects in the eastern states, <a href=\"https://www.infrastructureaustralia.gov.au/listing/media-release/Infrastructure-market-capacity-2022-risks-to-project-delivery-increase-as-5-year-investment-climbs-by-%2415b\">according to Infrastructure Australia</a>.</p> <h2>Do regional communities support it?</h2> <p>Regional people seem to like the theory, if not the reality, of the project.</p> <p>Community confidence in the management of the ARTC, following Schott\u2019s damning report, is going to be just one of the challenges ahead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/06/albanese-government-commits-to-half-of-inland-rail-project-after-blowouts-delay-and-mismanagement\">Albanese government commits to half of Inland Rail project after blowouts, delay and mismanagement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Inland rail staff are apparently gutted by the review and there is talk of internal restructures, following a recommendation to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/06/albanese-government-commits-to-half-of-inland-rail-project-after-blowouts-delay-and-mismanagement\">focus on the southern end of the project from Melbourne to Parkes.</a></p> <p>For all their concerns, regional communities are generally supportive of the concept.</p> <p>They get the freight requirements across such a big country and they assume <em>someone</em> has done their homework on the business case, which may be a triumph of optimism over experience.</p> <p>That latent support may be why both sides of politics support the inland rail.

Is it economically and environmentally sound? One of the selling points of the project is to ease traffic congestion around east coast cities and lower transport emissions. Government forecasts say that by 2050 the inland rail will cut carbon emissions by 750,000 tonnes a year and reduce the number of trucks on the road by 200,000. But Schott notes both the inland rail project and the operating business of ARTC are facing more pressing challenges. ARTC currently relies heavily on transporting coal \u2013 according to its 2021-22 annual report, 63% of its revenue related to the coal industry. In that same report, ARTC is hoping markets developed around the inland rail will \u201calso reduce the risks associated with declining coal production\u201d. So the business case for the inland rail relied on the transport of coal but ARTC is relying on it to generate revenue to make up for the decline of the coal industry. The project may be as much a lifeline for the ARTC economically as it was for the National party politically. Can we do big infrastructure projects as a country? Anyone who has completed the smallest building task in the last few years knows building costs have blown out. The inland rail is just the latest in a long list of blowouts, the latest being the Sydney Metro program. Big infrastructure projects, many of them related to transport, are increasingly crimped by a mix of labour shortages, rising construction material costs and a concentration of projects in the eastern states, according to Infrastructure Australia. Do regional communities support it? Regional people seem to like the theory, if not the reality, of the project. Community confidence in the management of the ARTC, following Schott\u2019s damning report, is going to be just one of the challenges ahead. Inland rail staff are apparently gutted by the review and there is talk of internal restructures, following a recommendation to focus on the southern end of the project from Melbourne to Parkes. For all their concerns, regional communities are generally supportive of the concept. They get the freight requirements across such a big country and they assume someone has done their homework on the business case, which may be a triumph of optimism over experience. That latent support may be why both sides of politics support the inland rail. Anthony Albanese supported it right through opposition, though he was critical of the planning. It now falls to his government to get it moving.

Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Yet many critics, even ones supportive of the rail, were dismissed by National party ministers keen to promote the project without question. They were also dismissed by the commonwealth-owned Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC), the body responsible for the governance and delivery of the inland rail. Here are some of the key questions addressed by the Schott review. What is the price tag? Schott compares the distance to be traversed by the inland rail to a journey between London and the Ukraine border. It crosses three states and the lands of at least 11 First Nations groups and 36 local government areas. The scope of the project makes it hard to cost. \u201cThere is insufficient certainty about the completion date and the final cost to have confidence in the current estimates,\u201d Schott wrote. How well was it planned? Not very well. Schott said the challenges of delivering the project \u201cdo not seem to have been fully appreciated by either ARTC or its shareholder [the federal government] when it was first given the go-ahead\u201d. Many communities along the route say they engaged with ARTC but their misgivings about noise or the proposed route cleaving towns in two were ignored in the rush to get the project started. The Narrabri civil engineer and water irrigation specialist Jim Purcell\u2019s sentiment was typical of communities along the tracks: if it\u2019s such an important project, why not do it right the first time? Purcell and other Narrabri residents were concerned the rail would exacerbate the risk from flooding. When their concerns were put to the then infrastructure minister Barnaby Joyce, he said consideration of alternative routes would take too long. What will it carry? According to Schott, by 2050, 70% of the freight to be carried on Inland Rail will be for domestic use, including household goods and groceries produced in Australia and consumed in our major cities. The 2015 business case prepared by the former Nationals leader John Anderson estimated that \u201cover half of the total demand for Inland Rail by volume\u201d would come from coal. There is not a lot of other information in the public realm about who the freight customers will be and how the goods will move, except that they have to make the journey in 24 hours to compete against the trucking industry. Is it economically and environmentally sound? One of the selling points of the project is to ease traffic congestion around east coast cities and lower transport emissions. Government forecasts say that by 2050 the inland rail will cut carbon emissions by 750,000 tonnes a year and reduce the number of trucks on the road by 200,000. But Schott notes both the inland rail project and the operating business of ARTC are facing more pressing challenges. ARTC currently relies heavily on transporting coal \u2013 according to its 2021-22 annual report, 63% of its revenue related to the coal industry. In that same report, ARTC is hoping markets developed around the inland rail will \u201calso reduce the risks associated with declining coal production\u201d. So the business case for the inland rail relied on the transport of coal but ARTC is relying on it to generate revenue to make up for the decline of the coal industry. The project may be as much a lifeline for the ARTC economically as it was for the National party politically. Can we do big infrastructure projects as a country? Anyone who has completed the smallest building task in the last few years knows building costs have blown out. The inland rail is just the latest in a long list of blowouts, the latest being the Sydney Metro program. Big infrastructure projects, many of them related to transport, are increasingly crimped by a mix of labour shortages, rising construction material costs and a concentration of projects in the eastern states, according to Infrastructure Australia.

He predicted a more realistic price tag than the then $14bn budget was $40bn. It was eerily prescient.</p> \n<p>This week, Simpkins told me while it was great to feel vindicated, it should not have taken so long.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that it\u2019s taken an external party, following on from me going public, for these people to suddenly wake up and realise that their work is not as good as they think it was,\u201d he said.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/14/sign-up-for-rural-network-guardian-australia-email-newsletter-about-regional-affairs?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter</a></strong></p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Yet many critics, even ones supportive of the rail, were dismissed by National party ministers keen to promote the project without question. They were also dismissed by the commonwealth-owned Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC), the body responsible for the governance and delivery of the inland rail.</p> \n<p>Here are some of the key questions addressed by the Schott review.</p> \n<h2>What is the price tag?</h2> \n<p>Schott compares the distance to be traversed by the inland rail to a journey between London and the Ukraine border. It crosses three states and the lands of at least 11 First Nations groups and 36 local government areas. </p> \n<p>The scope of the project makes it hard to cost. \u201cThere is insufficient certainty about the completion date and the final cost to have confidence in the current estimates,\u201d Schott wrote.</p> \n<h2>How well was it planned?</h2> \n<p>Not very well. Schott said the challenges of delivering the project \u201cdo not seem to have been fully appreciated by either ARTC or its shareholder [the federal government] when it was first given the go-ahead\u201d.</p> \n<p>Many communities along the route say they engaged with ARTC but their misgivings about noise or the proposed route cleaving towns in two were ignored in the rush to get the project started.</p> \n<p>The Narrabri civil engineer and water irrigation specialist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/16/inland-rail-review-supports-concerns-raised-by-regional-communities\">Jim Purcell\u2019s sentiment was typical of communities along the tracks</a>: if it\u2019s such an important project, why not do it right the first time? Purcell and other Narrabri residents were concerned the rail would exacerbate the risk from flooding. When their concerns were put to the then infrastructure minister Barnaby Joyce, he said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/what-the-hell-were-you-thinking-fighting-flares-in-narrabri-over-inland-rail\">consideration of alternative routes would take too long</a>.</p> \n<h2>What will it carry?</h2> \n<p>According to Schott, by 2050, 70% of the freight to be carried on Inland Rail will be for domestic use, including household goods and groceries produced in Australia and consumed in our major cities.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2015-08/apo-nid220986_1.pdf\">2015 business case</a> prepared by the former Nationals leader John Anderson estimated that \u201cover half of the total demand for Inland Rail by volume\u201d would come from coal. </p> \n<p>There is not a lot of other information in the public realm about who the freight customers will be and how the goods will move, except that they have to make the journey in 24 hours to compete against the trucking industry. </p> \n<h2>Is it economically and environmentally sound?</h2> \n<p>One of the selling points of the project is to ease traffic congestion around east coast cities and lower transport emissions. <a href=\"https://www.inlandrail.gov.au/understanding-inland-rail/why-inland-rail/environment\">Government</a> forecasts say that by 2050 the inland rail will cut carbon emissions by 750,000 tonnes a year and reduce the number of trucks on the road by 200,000. </p> \n<p>But Schott notes both the inland rail project and the operating business of ARTC are facing more pressing challenges. ARTC currently relies heavily on transporting coal \u2013 according to <a href=\"https://www.artc.com.au/uploads/ARTC-Annual-Report-2021-2022.pdf\">its 2021-22 annual report</a>, 63% of its revenue related to the coal industry.</p> \n<p>In that same report, ARTC is hoping markets developed around the inland rail will \u201calso reduce the risks associated with declining coal production\u201d.</p> \n<p>So the business case for the inland rail relied on the transport of coal but ARTC is relying on it to generate revenue to make up for the decline of the coal industry. The project may be as much a lifeline for the ARTC economically as it was for the National party politically.</p> \n<h2>Can we do big infrastructure projects as a country?</h2> \n<p>Anyone who has completed the smallest building task in the last few years knows building costs have blown out. The inland rail is just the latest in a long list of blowouts, the latest being the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/13/nsw-government-launches-sydney-metro-review-amid-21bn-cost-blowout\">Sydney Metro program</a>.</p> \n<p>Big infrastructure projects, many of them related to transport, are <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/warning-that-more-mega-projects-will-run-late-over-budget-20221213-p5c5x1.html\">increasingly crimped</a> by a mix of labour shortages, rising construction material costs and a concentration of projects in the eastern states, <a href=\"https://www.infrastructureaustralia.gov.au/listing/media-release/Infrastructure-market-capacity-2022-risks-to-project-delivery-increase-as-5-year-investment-climbs-by-%2415b\">according to Infrastructure Australia</a>.</p> \n<h2>Do regional communities support it?</h2> \n<p>Regional people seem to like the theory, if not the reality, of the project.</p> \n<p>Community confidence in the management of the ARTC, following Schott\u2019s damning report, is going to be just one of the challenges ahead.</p>"}}, {"type": "rich-link", "assets": [], "richLinkTypeData": {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/06/albanese-government-commits-to-half-of-inland-rail-project-after-blowouts-delay-and-mismanagement", "originalUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/06/albanese-government-commits-to-half-of-inland-rail-project-after-blowouts-delay-and-mismanagement", "linkText": "Albanese government commits to half of Inland Rail project after blowouts, delay and mismanagement", "linkPrefix": "Related: ", "role": "thumbnail"}}, {"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>Inland rail staff are apparently gutted by the review and there is talk of internal restructures, following a recommendation to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/06/albanese-government-commits-to-half-of-inland-rail-project-after-blowouts-delay-and-mismanagement\">focus on the southern end of the project from Melbourne to Parkes.</a></p> \n<p>For all their concerns, regional communities are generally supportive of the concept.</p> \n<p>They get the freight requirements across such a big country and they assume <em>someone</em> has done their homework on the business case, which may be a triumph of optimism over experience.</p> \n<p>That latent support may be why both sides of politics support the inland rail.

Young lodged a formal complaint with Labor but the party chose not to expel Madden after an investigation in February that found he had breached 22 of its rules. Queensland Labor\u2019s state secretary, Kate Flanders, said none of the findings met the threshold for Madden to be kicked out of the party and that he had denied the bullying allegations. \u201cThey were findings where perhaps their workplace relationship was not what it should be,\u201d Flanders told reporters last week. \u201cWe are undertaking some proactive training with Jim about how to create and ensure there is a safe and productive work environment.\u201d Flanders confirmed last week that due to Labor party quotas, two current male Labor MPs would not be able to re-contest the next election.

Over recent months the momentum for constitutional change has stalled, the strong and instinctive public goodwill dissipated by internal negotiations in pursuit of a bipartisanship that is beyond the current federal Coalition. The messaging around the yes vote has softened from a hard \u201cvoice\u201d to a greater emphasis on \u201cconstitutional recognition\u201d, a position previously rejected by First Nations leaders concerned that symbolism isn\u2019t enough to address the consequences of their historical injustice. In this period of conspicuous moderation, support among Liberal voters had marginally increased, but the younger progressive vote had started to slide in echoes of the 1999 republic debacle where milquetoast reform was rejected not for its ambition but for its lack thereof. Dutton\u2019s rejection of bipartisanship liberates the yes campaign from this tepid incrementalism, allowing the campaign to reconnect with the roadmap originally laid out in the Uluru statement from the heart. This week\u2019s Guardian Essential report shows that in the week since Dutton rejected this generous invitation to walk forward, this slide in support has been arrested and progressive support is again rising. Now Dutton provides the campaign with a ready-made villain: not simply the charmless champion for an unacceptable status quo, but the entitled white guy who wants to control every detail of a process designed for and by people with less power and privilege than him. As the putative leader of the no campaign, Dutton becomes an apologist for every libertarian lapdog and racist fringe dweller who will be drawn to the no banner, rightly required to answer for every one of their rhetorical excesses. Dutton will continue to campaign on the tyranny of detail, a wilfully deceptive misrepresentation of the question on the referendum ballot, trying to spread both fear and panic around the status quo while pretending that nothing really needs to change. He will attempt to wish away the inherent contradictions in his position while spreading disdain for the very idea of nationhood, with his derisive and disingenuous \u201cCanberra Voice\u201d straw man. But he will do so with established credentials of a bad faith actor who walked out of the apology to the stolen generations and was part of a government that cut half a billion dollars from health and education programs in remote communities while sending in the Australian federal police to \u201cintervene\u201d in them. Less Canberra Voice, more Canberra Vice. Dutton has never been popular, but this decision forces him into a premature showdown with a first-term leader who will garner a vocal constituency across business and civil society. The raw figures show the extent of this mismatch. That Dutton lacks the smarts to see the opportunity to work side by side with a popular prime minister, rising above politics, as Albanese did when the pandemic first hit, probably renders him ineligible for higher office at the get-go. What does the Liberal party do with these numbers? It would be easy to say that the hardheads should step in and see the folly of this strategy. The problem for the Liberals is that the hardheads are no longer running the party. Indeed, the hardheads like \u201cturn back the boats\u201d and Brexit mastermind Mark Textor and Howard-era campaign director Tony Nutt are actually on the yes campaign oversight board. The tragedy for anyone who likes the idea of a two-party democratic system is that the softheads now in charge are the group fixated on playing to their base rather than building genuine, er, coalitions. As for the yes campaign, the opportunity now is to reinvigorate the journey to the voice by looking outwards rather than accommodating inwards, and reassuring the majority of soft voters whose primary concern is that a yes vote will not lead to meaningful change. This reassurance starts with the voice\u2019s remarkable source document. No Australian who spends the time to read or listen to the Uluru statement from the heart could tolerate anything but a successful yes vote. Like all good manifestos, it persuasively and poetically answers the cynical and pernickety questions of detail while explaining how the status quo is no longer tenable. It elegantly lays out the problem from the specific: \u201cWe are the most incarcerated people on the planet. But we are not an innately criminal people\u201d, to the systemic: \u201cThe torment of our powerlessness.\u201d But it also demands more than a narrow yes vote with a bare majority of states. The invitation is to start a journey that deploys a First Nations voice, not just to make better decisions now but to guide us towards treaty in order to confront the terrible, unspoken truths that lie at the heart of our nation\u2019s soul. At just over 400 words it is a bit too long for a meme, but it is hardly War and Peace. Each Australian who takes the four minutes\u2019 time to read it will find themselves not just informed about the \u201cdetail\u201d but inspired to join their brothers and sisters as they \u201cleave base camp\u201d. I\u2019m proud to be working with the campaign and will, over the coming months, be rolling out a series of Town Hall meetings across the nation that will give every Australian the chance to listen to this eloquent and generous invitation. There is also a program of kitchen table conversations, inspired by the \u201cvoices of\u201d community independent movement, that will be convening from May under the banner Together Yes. There will be space in the room for anyone who wants to ask questions and be reassured that this is a meaningful step forward that will make a difference. Sadly, there will no longer be a place for the opposition leader, although the voices of those including Bridget Archer, Julian Lesser, Ken Wyatt and Tasmanian premier Jeremy Rockliff will only serve to highlight a liberalism he has deliberately purged from his party. They realise what Dutton is wilfully blind to: that this is much more than a contest of legal models, it is an opportunity to create the consensus to finally build a nation on solid foundations.

Over recent months the momentum for constitutional change has stalled, the strong and instinctive public goodwill dissipated by internal negotiations in pursuit of a bipartisanship that is beyond the current federal Coalition. The messaging around the yes vote has softened from a hard \u201cvoice\u201d to a greater emphasis on \u201cconstitutional recognition\u201d, a position previously rejected by First Nations leaders concerned that symbolism isn\u2019t enough to address the consequences of their historical injustice. In this period of conspicuous moderation, support among Liberal voters had marginally increased, but the younger progressive vote had started to slide in echoes of the 1999 republic debacle where milquetoast reform was rejected not for its ambition but for its lack thereof.\nDutton\u2019s rejection of bipartisanship liberates the yes campaign from this tepid incrementalism, allowing the campaign to reconnect with the roadmap originally laid out in the Uluru statement from the heart. This week\u2019s Guardian Essential report shows that in the week since Dutton rejected this generous invitation to walk forward, this slide in support has been arrested and progressive support is again rising.\nNow Dutton provides the campaign with a ready-made villain: not simply the charmless champion for an unacceptable status quo, but the entitled white guy who wants to control every detail of a process designed for and by people with less power and privilege than him. As the putative leader of the no campaign, Dutton becomes an apologist for every libertarian lapdog and racist fringe dweller who will be drawn to the no banner, rightly required to answer for every one of their rhetorical excesses. Dutton will continue to campaign on the tyranny of detail, a wilfully deceptive misrepresentation of the question on the referendum ballot, trying to spread both fear and panic around the status quo while pretending that nothing really needs to change. He will attempt to wish away the inherent contradictions in his position while spreading disdain for the very idea of nationhood, with his derisive and disingenuous \u201cCanberra Voice\u201d straw man. But he will do so with established credentials of a bad faith actor who walked out of the apology to the stolen generations and was part of a government that cut half a billion dollars from health and education programs in remote communities while sending in the Australian federal police to \u201cintervene\u201d in them. Less Canberra Voice, more Canberra Vice. Dutton has never been popular, but this decision forces him into a premature showdown with a first-term leader who will garner a vocal constituency across business and civil society. The raw figures show the extent of this mismatch.\nThat Dutton lacks the smarts to see the opportunity to work side by side with a popular prime minister, rising above politics, as Albanese did when the pandemic first hit, probably renders him ineligible for higher office at the get-go. What does the Liberal party do with these numbers? It would be easy to say that the hardheads should step in and see the folly of this strategy. The problem for the Liberals is that the hardheads are no longer running the party. Indeed, the hardheads like \u201cturn back the boats\u201d and Brexit mastermind Mark Textor and Howard-era campaign director Tony Nutt are actually on the yes campaign oversight board.\nThe tragedy for anyone who likes the idea of a two-party democratic system is that the softheads now in charge are the group fixated on playing to their base rather than building genuine, er, coalitions. As for the yes campaign, the opportunity now is to reinvigorate the journey to the voice by looking outwards rather than accommodating inwards, and reassuring the majority of soft voters whose primary concern is that a yes vote will not lead to meaningful change.\nThis reassurance starts with the voice\u2019s remarkable source document. No Australian who spends the time to read or listen to the Uluru statement from the heart could tolerate anything but a successful yes vote. Like all good manifestos, it persuasively and poetically answers the cynical and pernickety questions of detail while explaining how the status quo is no longer tenable.

The complaint is the latest part of AFD\u2019s campaign to end dolphin hunting in Taiji, where the annual slaughter of hundreds of dolphins was the subject of 2009 Oscar-winning documentary The Cove. Other dolphins are kept alive and sold to aquariums and marine parks. In a rare interview several years ago, local dolphin hunters told the Guardian that they were simply protecting a traditional industry and accused opponents of attempting to destroy the area\u2019s culinary traditions. Tests conducted by AFD in 2020 and 2021 revealed mercury levels in dolphin meat between 12 and 25 times the regulatory limit. The organisation launched a criminal complaint against the sale of toxic whale and dolphin meat in 2021, but prosecutors decided not to take action. Studies of people who regularly consume cetacean products show that mercury and other contaminants can have an adverse effect on foetal development, neural development and memory, as well as increasing the risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s disease, hypertension and arteriosclerosis in adults. A 2010 study by the National Institute for Minamata Disease \u2013 which Tait described as \u201cflawed\u201d \u2013 found that levels of mercury detected in Taiji residents were above the national average, probably due to their consumption of whale and dolphin meat. Further tests found they had suffered no ill effects, however. The tests involved hair samples from 1,137 of the town\u2019s approximately 3,500 residents.", "attributes": {}, "published": true, "createdDate": "2023-04-18T01:17:53Z", "firstPublishedDate": "2023-04-18T06:24:08Z", "publishedDate": "2023-04-18T06:24:08Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-04-18T06:24:08Z", "contributors": [], "elements": [{"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>Marine conservation campaigners have lodged a complaint with police demanding that \u201ctoxic\u201d dolphin meat be removed from sale in Japan, after a test showed a sample contained levels of mercury up to 100 times higher than the government\u2019s recommended safe level.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.afd.org.au/\">Action for Dolphins</a> (AFD), a nonprofit based in Australia, filed the complaint with police in central Japan this month, amid expert warnings that regular consumption of dolphin meat could threaten the health of consumers.</p> \n<p>AFD said recent testing at a laboratory in Japan revealed that one sample bought in the country \u2013 a portion of Risso\u2019s dolphin offal \u2013 exceeded the government-set regulatory limit of mercury by up to 97.5 times.

February by firing its controlling board and installing a handpicked board of Republican allies, including one who <a

Monday denounced the agreement as a legally unsound \u201csham\u201d, and announced a new measure that would return control of the special district that is home to Disney World to a state oversight board run by the governor\u2019s appointees.</p> <p>Among other things, the new measures include passing authority for the inspection of theme park rides and transportation to the state, increasing

Rodgers: Australian transgender basketball hopeful breaks silence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To assess Rodgers\u2019 case BA convened an expert panel led by Dr Peter Harcourt (BA chief medical officer, Commonwealth Games medical advisor), Suzy Batkovic OLY (BA board member, three-time Olympian) and Assoc Prof Diana Robinson.<br><br>BA said in a statement they assess eligibility of prospective elite-level transgender athletes \u201con a \u2018case-by-case\u2019 basis, accounting for and balancing a range of factors\u201d, without specifying those factors.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re still on a path of education and understanding,\u201d the governing body acknowledged. \u201cThe balance of inclusivity, fairness and the competitive nature of sport will always be a complex area to navigate, and we thank those involved who have maintained integrity and respect throughout the process.\u201d<br><br>Basketball Australia\u2019s director, Suzy Batkovic, said: \u201cI\u2019d like to acknowledge and sincerely thank Lexi for her cooperation, understanding and patience throughout this process \u2013 it\u2019s a complex space that continues to evolve.<br><br>\u201cWhile Lexi is understandably disappointed with the outcome, I know she\u2019ll continue to support her NBL1 South team throughout the season and be an active member of the basketball community.<br><br>In informing Rodgers and the Kilsyth Cobras of the decision, Batkovic added: \u201cI also want to make it clear, because it\u2019s important, that while this particular application was not approved based on criteria for elite competition, Basketball Australia encourages and promotes inclusivity at community level.\u201d</p> <p>Rodgers was a talented junior player but has previously acknowledged that transitioning might preclude her from playing the sport at the highest level, including her ultimate dream of representing the Opals.</p> <p>In response to BA\u2019s decision, Rodgers expressed her disappointment with the ruling and the message it projects.</p> <p>\u201cI sought a different outcome from Basketball Australia,\u201d Rodgers wrote in an Instagram post. \u201cI participated fully and in good faith with the process and eligibility criteria. Consistent with the views expressed by so many, I firmly believe I have a place as an athlete in women\u2019s basketball.</p> <p>\u201cBasketball is one of the great loves of my life. Like so many people who play every week across the country, the basketball court is where I feel safe, where I feel free, and where I feel I belong.</p> <p>\u201cThe backing of the players, coaches, my club and grassroots members has been overwhelming. I am so grateful for their desire to have me as part of their community. Such support fills me with pride, but also sends an honest message of equality to those who are also seeking belonging within sport.</p> <p>Rodgers said she would continue to advocate for transgender athletes and gender-diverse inclusion in sports.</p> <p>\u201cI hope Basketball Australia understands that this is not the end of my journey as an athlete and that it must not miss future opportunities to demonstrate its values,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am sad about the potential message this decision sends to trans and gender-diverse people everywhere.

To assess Rodgers\u2019 case BA convened an expert panel led by Dr Peter Harcourt (BA chief medical officer, Commonwealth Games medical advisor), Suzy Batkovic OLY (BA board member, three-time Olympian) and Assoc Prof Diana Robinson. BA said in a statement they assess eligibility of prospective elite-level transgender athletes \u201con a \u2018case-by-case\u2019 basis, accounting for and balancing a range of factors\u201d, without specifying those factors. \u201cWe\u2019re still on a path of education and understanding,\u201d the governing body acknowledged. \u201cThe balance of inclusivity, fairness and the competitive nature of sport will always be a complex area to navigate, and we thank those involved who have maintained integrity and respect throughout the process.\u201d Basketball Australia\u2019s director, Suzy Batkovic, said: \u201cI\u2019d like to acknowledge and sincerely thank Lexi for her cooperation, understanding and patience throughout this process \u2013 it\u2019s a complex space that continues to evolve. \u201cWhile Lexi is understandably disappointed with the outcome, I know she\u2019ll continue to support her NBL1 South team throughout the season and be an active member of the basketball community. In informing Rodgers and the Kilsyth Cobras of the decision, Batkovic added: \u201cI also want to make it clear, because it\u2019s important, that while this particular application was not approved based on criteria for elite competition, Basketball Australia encourages and promotes inclusivity at community level.\u201d Rodgers was a talented junior player but has previously acknowledged that transitioning might preclude her from playing the sport at the highest level, including her ultimate dream of representing the Opals. In response to BA\u2019s decision, Rodgers expressed her disappointment with the ruling and the message it projects. \u201cI sought a different outcome from Basketball Australia,\u201d Rodgers wrote in an Instagram post. \u201cI participated fully and in good faith with the process and eligibility criteria. Consistent with the views expressed by so many, I firmly believe I have a place as an athlete in women\u2019s basketball. \u201cBasketball is one of the great loves of my life. Like so many people who play every week across the country, the basketball court is where I feel safe, where I feel free, and where I feel I belong. \u201cThe backing of the players, coaches, my club and grassroots members has been overwhelming. I am so grateful for their desire to have me as part of their community. Such support fills me with pride, but also sends an honest message of equality to those who are also seeking belonging within sport. Rodgers said she would continue to advocate for transgender athletes and gender-diverse inclusion in sports. \u201cI hope Basketball Australia understands that this is not the end of my journey as an athlete and that it must not miss future opportunities to demonstrate its values,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am sad about the potential message this decision sends to trans and gender-diverse people everywhere.

Ablett has launched proceedings in the Victorian supreme court against the AFL, Geelong Football Club and Hawthorn Football Club. The 61-year-old claims he suffered concussions while training and playing throughout his AFL career, which ran between 1982 and 1997. The Geelong icon is the highest-profile former player to reveal his health issues in relation to on-field concussion, now a major issue in world sport. A class action led by former Melbourne star Shaun Smith, Adelaide Crows premiership player Darren Jarman and the family of the late Shane Tuck was launched last month and more than 60 former players have signed up for the legal action, seeking compensation for pain and suffering, economic loss and medical expenses relating to permanent damage from concussions and other head knocks. Lawyers acting for Ablett said he underwent a scan last year which revealed brain damage. They claim the league and Ablett\u2019s former clubs \u201cknew or ought to have known of the potential long-term consequences of concussion suffered by the plaintiff\u201d. The court writ lodged says the AFL and two clubs owed Ablett a duty of care and should have avoided exposing him to unnecessary risk of harm, given he was more vulnerable to head strikes when playing as a key forward in 248 VFL/AFL games. Ablett alleges the organisations breached that duty and were negligent, and he has subsequently suffered loss, injury and damage as a result of the concussions. Ablett is claiming damages, interests and costs in the supreme court proceedings. \u201cI started getting symptoms that alarmed me to the point where I contacted Peter Jess, whom I\u2019m aware has been a concussion advocate for a number of past players,\u201d Ablett told News Corp. \u201cI told him of my concerns and Peter helped organise an MEG scan that American Military use. It showed I have significant structural and functional brain damage. \u201cObviously I was a very physical player and while I only got totally knocked out eight-10 times, I experienced being semi-concussed, such as ears ringing and out of it for a few minutes many dozens of times. But because you weren\u2019t knocked completely out you wouldn\u2019t even bother mentioning it.\u201d Ablett\u2019s lawyer Michel Margalit said Ablett was dealing with significant health problems. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing well. He\u2019s had significant illness over the previous years and he\u2019s finding that he\u2019s struggling more and more as time goes on,\u201d she told ABC News Breakfast. \u201cHe has really significant medical and care needs, and there are just no funds available through the AFL Players Association or any other hardship fund to assist him with those care needs.\u201d Margalit would not say how much Ablett was seeking but said it was a significant claim. \u201cIt is a very substantial case and could be really at the upper range of the allowance permitted by the compensation schemes in Victoria,\u201d she said. \u201cThis could be multiple millions of dollars.\u201d Last week, the AFL released a statement saying it had made more than 30 changes to concussion protocols, tribunal guidelines and on-field rules to protect players\u2019 heads. It also released a strategic plan for sport-related concussion in Australian football.

It will be most visible in the Ningaloo region of Western Australia. Thousands of people will visit the small coastal town of Exmouth to witness this spectacular event, while Australians elsewhere will experience a partial eclipse. It is imperative to take steps to protect your eyes from solar retinopathy \u2013 permanent eye damage caused by looking at directly at the sun. Expert guidelines advise people to never look at the sun or an eclipse with the naked eye. Any direct viewing should only be done with the correct use of approved solar eclipse glasses that meet an international safety standard known as ISO 12312-2.\nAlso known as sun blindness, solar retinopathy has been recognised since ancient Greece. It affected astronomers including Sir Isaac Newton, who once used a mirror to look at the sun and saw \u201cafterimages for months\u201d. Looking too closely In Turkey in 1976 58 patients sought treatment for eye damage after an eclipse. While some experienced initial improvements, the damage in others was unchanged 15 years later. In 1999 45 people presented to the eye casualty department of Leicester Royal Infirmary after an eclipse seen there. Retinopathy was confirmed in 40 of them. Seven months later four people could still see \u201cthe ghosts of the damage\u201d in their visual field. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup And, after the solar eclipse of August 2017, 27 patients in the US state of Utah presented with concerns about vision. For those people affected by solar retinopathy, the results can be devastating and lifelong. What happens to your eye when you stare at the sun? Solar retinopathy is damage to the back of the eye (the fovea centralis in the retina) from exposure to intense light. It is typically caused by sungazing or eclipse viewing but can also result from welding without a shield, looking at laser pointers and from some surgical and photographic lighting. A process called \u201cphototoxicity\u201d happens when the energy in the light forms damaging free radicals and reacts with oxygen within the retina. This disrupts the retinal pigment epithelium (a layer of supportive cells beneath the retina) as well as the choriocapillaris (blood vessels) beneath. Fragmentation of the photoreceptors, nerve cells within the retina that detect light and colour, follows and can result in permanent loss of central vision. Some wavelengths of light that cause solar retinopathy \u2013 such as ultraviolet-A radiation and near infrared wavelengths \u2013 are not visible to humans, yet cause solar retinopathy in as little as a few seconds. This exposure doesn\u2019t necessarily hurt at the time. So eclipse gazing \u2013 even with little or no visible light and viewed briefly without pain \u2013 can lead to loss of vision. There is no effective treatment There is no proven treatment for solar retinopathy. Steroid medications have been tried without evidence of success and may make things worse in some patients. Antioxidant medications are used in some eye diseases but there are no studies showing a benefit in cases of solar retinopathy. Vision may improve over time without treatment but many patients are left with residual deficits. The mainstay of management is therefore prevention. Five tips for spotting proper eclipse specs Only approved glasses will absorb the appropriate wavelengths of visible, ultraviolet and infrared light. They must: 1. Be bought from reputable vendors to ensure they are not counterfeits. 2. Display the correct safety certification (ISO 12312-2). 3. Not be scratched, cracked or show any other signs of damage. 4.

Be checked by looking at a lamp or light bulb \u2013 only light from the sun should be visible through genuine eclipse glasses. This check doesn\u2019t risk eye damage provided the previous steps have been followed. In Exmouth in WA, the local chamber of commerce and industry has bought some 20,000 eclipse viewing glasses which meet the international ISO safety standard. Regular sunglasses, welding shields, X-ray film, neutral density filters, red glass filters, mobile phones and homemade sun filters are not safe for viewing the sun or an eclipse. What if you think the damage is done? Symptoms to watch out for include blurred vision in one or both eyes within one to two days of exposure. People may also experience blind spots, altered colour vision, visual distortion (straight lines appearing kinked or wavy), micropsia (objects appearing smaller than normal), light sensitivity and headache.
