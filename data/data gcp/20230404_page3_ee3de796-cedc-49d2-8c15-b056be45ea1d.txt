Then, the climax having been achieved, each frog deflates, its mouth shrinks, the face puckers up, reminding me ever so slightly of my beloved grandmother in her late eighties.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Country diary is on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdncountrydiary?lang=en\" title=\"\">@gdncountrydiary</a></p>"}}]}], "totalBodyBlocks": 1}, "rights": {"syndicatable": "true", "subscriptionDatabases": "true", "developerCommunity": "true"}, "section": {"id": "environment", "webTitle": "Environment", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/environment", "editions": [{"id": "environment", "webTitle": "Environment", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/environment", "code": "default"}, {"id": "au/environment", "webTitle": "Environment", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/au/environment", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/au/environment", "code": "au"}, {"id": "uk/environment", "webTitle": "Environment", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/environment", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/environment", "code": "uk"}, {"id": "us/environment", "webTitle": "Environment", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us/environment", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/us/environment", "code": "us"}]}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2023/apr/04/tank-tactics-how-ukraine-use-influx-western-armour", "type": "article", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webPublicationDate": "2023-04-04T04:00:36Z", "webTitle": "Tank tactics: how might Ukraine use its influx of western armour?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/04/tank-tactics-how-ukraine-use-influx-western-armour", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/04/tank-tactics-how-ukraine-use-influx-western-armour", "fields": {"headline": "Tank tactics: how might Ukraine use its influx of western armour?", "standfirst": "<p>Experts say weaponry will give Kyiv a psychological edge against Russia but is not enough for a \u2018big punch\u2019</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/ukraine-live/latest\">Russia-Ukraine war \u2013 latest news updates</a></strong></li></ul>", "trailText": "Experts say weaponry will give Kyiv a psychological edge against Russia but is not enough for a \u2018big punch\u2019", "byline": "Peter Beaumont", "main": "<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c62f5fa92cc759f787026fcaabf9bc82d0c24d54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c62f5fa92cc759f787026fcaabf9bc82d0c24d54/0_363_7955_4773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukrainian recruits and their British trainers complete a session on the operation of a Challenger 2 tank at a military facility in southern England\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ukrainian recruits and their British trainers complete a session on the operation of a Challenger 2 tank at a military facility in southern England. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>", "body": "<p>In an anonymous muddy field somewhere in Ukraine, the country\u2019s defence minister crouched in the commander\u2019s hatch of a British Challenger 2 tank, one of the first three of 14 to be delivered to Kyiv.</p> <p>In a maroon jacket and matching baseball cap, Oleksii Reznikov gave a thumbs-up as he thanked the UK for the delivery of the system.</p> <p>It is not only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/27/ukrainian-troops-return-home-after-challenger-2-tank-training-in-uk\">Challenger main battle tanks</a> that are arriving.

In recent weeks a steady flow of donated armour has been arriving in Ukraine. German Leopard 2 tanks and Marder infantry fighting vehicles, US Strykers and Cougars, scores in number, have been shipped discretely, with more to follow.

And while over the winter Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodmyr Zelenskiy, had been pressing for 300 main battle tanks as well as other vehicles and modern fighter jets, the much more modest numbers that have so far arrived is fuelling speculation over how that armour may be used in the coming weeks and months.

Instead, analysts \u2013 including former British tank commanders \u2013 anticipate a counteroffensive, or counteroffensives, similar to those that took large amounts of territory from Russia in the late summer and autumn around Kharkiv oblast and in the country\u2019s south that led to the retaking of Kherson.

In recent weeks a steady flow of donated armour has been arriving in Ukraine. German Leopard 2 tanks and Marder infantry fighting vehicles, US Strykers and Cougars, scores in number, have been shipped discretely, with more to follow. The sudden influx of new armour, as well as the accelerated training of Ukrainian crews to operate the vehicles in the UK and elsewhere, comes ahead of the expectation \u2013 raised by senior Ukrainian officials \u2013 that they may soon be in action as part of the country\u2019s anticipated spring offensive.\nAnd while over the winter Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodmyr Zelenskiy, had been pressing for 300 main battle tanks as well as other vehicles and modern fighter jets, the much more modest numbers that have so far arrived is fuelling speculation over how that armour may be used in the coming weeks and months.\nWith Russia\u2019s own recent offensive in the eastern Donbas region apparently petering out with minimal gains and heavy losses, not least around the key eastern city of Bakhmut, there is little expectation that Ukraine has the resources for the kind of large-scale armoured thrust that Russia itself failed to carry off at the beginning of its invasion of Ukraine.

Among those who have been considering what the new armour arriving in Ukraine may mean for the war is Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, who served as a tank commander with 14th/20th King\u2019s Hussars in the first Gulf war before going on to command the UK\u2019s Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment.

The Philip review found that \u201con a conservative definition of non-compliance and fraud it is entirely feasible the value of non-compliance could exist in the range of $1.5bn to $3bn\u201d.

In some cases, the review found, doctors were deliberately doing the wrong thing.\nGuardian Australia then sent the Faux review and its key findings to the health minister, Mark Butler, after the federal election. Butler told the Guardian in August the former government had not been honest about the state of bulk billing.

But he said the figure he reached \u201ccomes with a significant caveat, in that there is real potential for the problem to scale to the order of magnitude in Dr Faux\u2019s analysis should effective controls, systems and education not be put in place\u201d. Butler said on Tuesday that the problems with Medicare \u201chave been a long time in the making\u201d. \u201cI had been drawing attention before the election to the lack of what I thought was clarity and transparency around bulk-billing data in particular, and we\u2019ve done a lot of work over the last few months to get much clearer data on what is happening,\u201d he said.

Current Nationals have had less clarity on One Nation, in spite of the party\u2019s history of singling out groups for their heritage or religion, whether it be Indigenous Australians, Asian Australians or Muslim Australians. Barnaby Joyce told his constituents in the 2022 election that One Nation had changed, that the party of 10 or 15 years ago was \u201cnot the party of today\u201d, as he justified his decision to preference the One Nation candidate. But it was a step closer when Joyce joined Hanson, broadcaster Alan Jones and former Labor minister Gary Johns for an event on Friday in his New England electorate, advertised as helping people to \u201cunderstand why you should oppose the voice to parliament\u201d. The reality was it placed Joyce on stage with someone his own Indigenous constituents accused of using racist talking points and \u201creally dehumanising\u201d language. Held in Tamworth, it was the first regional event of the Recognise A Better Way group, one of the most high-profile organisations campaigning against the voice. The group is led by Nyunggai Warren Mundine and its committee has Indigenous and non-Indigenous members, although none of the Indigenous committee members spoke in Tamworth that night. Whatever you think of the protagonists or the Indigenous voice to parliament, the speaker list promised controversy. In doing so, it provided an audience to hang a lantern over the no campaign. The purpose of that spotlight in a rural community is to show those wavering that there may be a critical mass against the voice, who may be people they know \u2013 people who have influence within their own social circles. So with First Nations people in the audience rather than on stage, regional Australia got a taste of what might lie ahead as we debate the proposed Indigenous voice. The political strategy boiled down to this slogan: if you don\u2019t know, vote no \u2013 reminiscent of the republic referendum and designed to sow doubt. But the idea was bedded down with spurious claims from the speakers and long forgotten terms like \u201cintermarriage\u201d. It is likely these people will lead the no campaign in regional areas with Joyce as a key protagonist. Indeed Joyce told the audience, which was a mix of constituents and visitors from as far as Western Australia, that he was \u201cpassionate\u201d in his opposition. It is four months since the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, fronted the cameras with Country Liberal party senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and most of his party to reveal the decision to oppose the voice, claiming it would not close the gap for Indigenous people. The Calare MP Andrew Gee quit the Nationals days later to support the voice and sit as an independent in a seat with a rising tree-change demographic. Since then, the Nationals as a party have avoided front-running the no case. But in contrast with Littleproud, Joyce is keen to take part and is arguing on different grounds from closing the gap. \u201cIf one group has a right based on their DNA, another group does not have that right,\u201d Joyce told the Tamworth crowd. Price is the other key voice of conservative MPs, as the face of the Fair Australia campaign against the voice. She has argued her consultations with people in remote areas show they either didn\u2019t know about the voice or didn\u2019t want it. This will leave Joyce and Price as the two rural MPs most associated with the no case. And what is clear in regional areas is the desire for detail flagged by audiences that both support and oppose the voice \u2013 a fact that Joyce is using. He described the proposal as \u201csneaky\u201d for lacking detail, even if he then painted a very detailed and dire picture of what the voice may become. Just weeks ago, the first regional forum was held with Labor senator and special envoy for reconciliation Pat Dodson in Ballarat. The audience appeared to be in favour but they were also hungry for the practicalities. \u201cPeople who live in the regions are far more practical,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey want to know how things work. Whereas we\u2019re talking about a principle here, which is significant because it\u2019s about the constitution. In a moral sense and an ethical sense, is this a good thing for us to do?\u201d Other campaigns are rolling out, including one from the folks who bought you the Voices For movement \u2013 with a series of kitchen table conversations. Under the banner Together, Yes, these groups are designed to promote quieter, respectful conversations inside homes that fly under the radar of the noisy media debate. The voice process has been a long time in the making. The list of community groups consulted during the co-design phase of the voice is long. Yet for all that consultation, it is clear from the Tamworth meeting that anti-voice forums could get a willing audience in regional areas. While that is sometimes the nature of democracy, the key questions is how voters in 2023 will react to divisive politics and how politicians write their own legacies.", "charCount": "5451", "shouldHideReaderRevenue": "false", "showAffiliateLinks": "false", "bylineHtml": "<a href=\"profile/gabrielle-chan\">Gabrielle Chan</a>", "showTableOfContents": "false"}, "tags": [{"id": "australia-news/series/the-rural-network", "type": "series", "sectionId": "australia-news", "sectionName": "Australia news", "webTitle": "The rural network", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/the-rural-network", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/series/the-rural-network", "references": [], "description": "<p>The rural network is supported by the Vincent Fairfax Family Foundation (VFFF)</p>", "activeSponsorships": [{"sponsorshipType": "sponsored", "sponsorName": "Vincent Fairfax Family Foundation", "sponsorLogo": "https://static.theguardian.com/commercial/sponsor/13/Sep/2021/40a26a5c-140e-4849-a15b-d9ced6982018-2257bec3-3a43-410f-8e19-89b0d687e26e-VFFF-footer-logo.png", "sponsorLink": "https://vfff.org.au/", "sponsorLogoDimensions": {"width": 200, "height": 142}, "validFrom": "2021-09-12T04:07:43Z", "validTo": "2050-09-01T04:07:00Z"}]}, {"id": "australia-news/indigenous-australians", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "australia-news", "sectionName": "Australia news", "webTitle": "Indigenous Australians", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/indigenous-australians", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/indigenous-australians", "references": [], "description": "Latest news and comment on Indigenous Australians"}, {"id": "australia-news/indigenous-voice-to-parliament", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "australia-news", "sectionName": "Australia news", "webTitle": "Indigenous voice to parliament", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/indigenous-voice-to-parliament", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/indigenous-voice-to-parliament", "references": [], "description": "<p>News, opinion and the latest updates on the proposed voice to Australia's parliament.

The political strategy boiled down to this slogan: if you don\u2019t know, vote no \u2013 reminiscent of the republic referendum and designed to sow doubt. But the idea was bedded down with spurious claims from the speakers and long forgotten terms like \u201cintermarriage\u201d. It is likely these people will lead the no campaign in regional areas with Joyce as a key protagonist. Indeed Joyce told the audience, which was a mix of constituents and visitors from as far as Western Australia, that he was \u201cpassionate\u201d in his opposition. It is four months since the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, fronted the cameras with Country Liberal party senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and most of his party to reveal the decision to oppose the voice, claiming it would not close the gap for Indigenous people. The Calare MP Andrew Gee quit the Nationals days later to support the voice and sit as an independent in a seat with a rising tree-change demographic. Since then, the Nationals as a party have avoided front-running the no case. But in contrast with Littleproud, Joyce is keen to take part and is arguing on different grounds from closing the gap. \u201cIf one group has a right based on their DNA, another group does not have that right,\u201d Joyce told the Tamworth crowd. Price is the other key voice of conservative MPs, as the face of the Fair Australia campaign against the voice. She has argued her consultations with people in remote areas show they either didn\u2019t know about the voice or didn\u2019t want it.\nThis will leave Joyce and Price as the two rural MPs most associated with the no case. And what is clear in regional areas is the desire for detail flagged by audiences that both support and oppose the voice \u2013 a fact that Joyce is using. He described the proposal as \u201csneaky\u201d for lacking detail, even if he then painted a very detailed and dire picture of what the voice may become. Just weeks ago, the first regional forum was held with Labor senator and special envoy for reconciliation Pat Dodson in Ballarat. The audience appeared to be in favour but they were also hungry for the practicalities. \u201cPeople who live in the regions are far more practical,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey want to know how things work. Whereas we\u2019re talking about a principle here, which is significant because it\u2019s about the constitution. In a moral sense and an ethical sense, is this a good thing for us to do?\u201d\nOther campaigns are rolling out, including one from the folks who bought you the Voices For movement \u2013 with a series of kitchen table conversations. Under the banner Together, Yes, these groups are designed to promote quieter, respectful conversations inside homes that fly under the radar of the noisy media debate. The voice process has been a long time in the making. The list of community groups consulted during the co-design phase of the voice is long. Yet for all that consultation, it is clear from the Tamworth meeting that anti-voice forums could get a willing audience in regional areas. While that is sometimes the nature of democracy, the key questions is how voters in 2023 will react to divisive politics and how politicians write their own legacies.", "attributes": {}, "published": true, "createdDate": "2023-04-04T02:28:44Z", "firstPublishedDate": "2023-04-04T02:28:44Z", "publishedDate": "2023-04-04T04:44:59Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-04-04T04:44:58Z", "contributors": [], "elements": [{"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>Just four years ago, Tim Fischer called on the National party to <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-27/tim-fischer-says-one-nation-should-pay-preference-price/10946118\">put One Nation last</a> on its how-to-vote cards.</p> \n<p>The late Nationals elder and former deputy prime minister had long held the line against One Nation\u2019s divisive rhetoric from Pauline Hanson\u2019s first entry into parliament in 1996.</p> \n<p>Fischer was joined by fellow Nationals members such as former Queensland senator Ron Boswell, who in his <a href=\"https://australianpolitics.com/2014/06/17/valedictory-speech-senator-ron-boswell.html\">farewell speech</a> told parliament that his efforts to defeat Hanson and her party were his \u201cgreatest achievement\u201d.</p> \n<p>Current Nationals have had less clarity on One Nation, in spite of the party\u2019s history of singling out groups for their heritage or religion, whether it be <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-10/timeline-rise-of-pauline-hanson-one-nation/7583230\">Indigenous Australians</a>, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-14/pauline-hanson-maiden-speech-asian-immigration/7645578\">Asian Australians</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/17/pauline-hanson-wears-burqa-in-australian-senate-while-calling-for-ban\">Muslim Australians</a>.</p>"}}, {"type": "rich-link", "assets": [], "richLinkTypeData": {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2023/mar/09/the-future-of-my-grandchildren-is-in-the-hands-of-all-australians-help-bring-our-dream-alive", "originalUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2023/mar/09/the-future-of-my-grandchildren-is-in-the-hands-of-all-australians-help-bring-our-dream-alive", "linkText": "The future of my grandchildren is in the hands of all Australians.

The Albanese government has made history winning a cost-of-living byelection; New South Wales has changed power in a contest where the hip pocket nerve was vigorously massaged; the upcoming federal budget will inevitably be framed around the issue as well. But there is a wilful blindness at the core of this crisis that risks diminishing the challenges people face by reducing them to a crude consumer price tag. The \u201ccost-of-living crisis\u201d has the vibe of a construct cooked up in one of those libertarian language labs that have shifted \u201cglobal warming\u201d to the more benign \u201cclimate change\u201d, \u201cpublic funding\u201d to the fiscally medicinal \u201ctax relief\u201d and \u201cprivatisation\u201d to \u201casset recycling\u201d. \u201cCost of living\u201d implies an inevitability to our current situation, as if this inflationary cycle is just a natural consequence of our worldly existence, part of the rhythm of our economic life that we need to accept. But there is nothing natural about the pain that households are currently feeling. It is the direct consequence of \u201ceconomically rational\u201d decisions (another triumph of rightwing framing) made by governments over many years. There is nothing natural about a housing system that privileges those who have accumulated capital over those who have not; nothing natural about the retail markets that dominate education, nothing natural about our unhealthy reliance on fossil fuels. As this week\u2019s Guardian Essential poll illustrates, these are decisions that are now undermining the economic security of many Australian households If cost of living is the question, the answer is a resounding \u201couch\u201d. One quarter of the population are doing it tough, another 40% are starting to feel the heat, leaving just a third in the comfort of the economic banana chair. This speaks to a second problem with the \u201ccost-of-living\u201d frame. It vests the challenge to find the money to pay the bills and mortgage in the individual, rather than seeing these as the inevitable consequence of turning essential services into private markets and transforming citizens into customers. As individual consumers it\u2019s on us to navigate the system, with the government\u2019s role confined to improving the flow of consumer information. Remember the Rudd government\u2019s impotent response to post-GFC rising prices with a string of price comparison websites? Finally, thinking of the current problem as a \u201ccrisis\u201d makes the moment seem transitory, more like an economic storm or bushfire to be weathered while absolving government of longer-term accountability for systemic failures. But a separate question suggests most people have not read the free market memo and expect the government to intervene with more than crisis payments and emergency accommodation. People, especially the young who are most affected by the impacts of inflation, believe government can \u2013 or more appositely could \u2013 make a difference if they chose to. It\u2019s what politicians do with that expectation that is more revealing. Ironically, for the conservative political parties that have always governed in the name of \u201cfree markets\u201d, blaming the new government for living costs requires a suspension of disbelief that not even the Murdoch echo chamber can sustain. This was borne out in the Coalition\u2019s abject failure in the Aston byelection over the weekend, where the federal Coalition discovered that simply shouting \u201ccost of living\u201d is not enough to convince people you have a plan. Meanwhile in NSW, Labor\u2019s successful prosecution of the \u201ccost-of-living crisis\u201d, a key issue in winning minority government, was more a series of Band-Aids placed on existing policy wounds than transformative change. NSW Labor promised to lift the 2.5% public sector wages cap designed to peg pay claims to inflation but now delivering declining living standards to nurses, teachers and many other tens of thousands who work directly for the government. It also pledged to end the Coalition\u2019s privatisation fetish and specifically vowed to keep Sydney Water, one of the few assets that hadn\u2019t been flogged off already, in public hands. Most gallingly, it promised to redirect significant taxpayer dollars to offset the exorbitant tolls multinational corporations are charging people to get around a city too reliant on private roads. Cost of living, indeed. A final table shows there is an appetite for government to take the discussion beyond the sticker and open a more honest discussion on the very architecture of our economy. These figures show the depth of public appetite for government intervention into the markets of essential services, not just at the point of sale, but at the source. Ideas that have been off the table for the best part of four decades including centrally mandated price caps on energy prices enjoy overwhelming public support. Tax cuts are also as popular as ever, highlighting the challenges in reversing even the regressive stage-three handouts to the wealthy. But it is support for systemic change that also stands out, starting with the shambolic childcare market that has placed unnecessary economic stress on young families while placing unfair barriers on women returning to paid employment. Turning this failing market into a coherent, universal early learning system will ease price pressure, increase immediate productivity and invest in kids for the long term. Speaking of working, the workplace minister, Tony Burke, has recognised one of the huge drivers of cost-of-living pressure is at the input end, a bargaining system designed to minimise wages for labour and maximise profits to capital. Even before our current \u201ccrisis\u201d, the Reserve Bank was warning of the impact of artificially low wages. Now it is these same Paye wage-earners who are facing the brunt of rising prices who are being most squeezed. There is strong support in our Guardian Essential poll for Burke\u2019s endorsement of a higher minimum wage; but this is not the only work on his agenda to get wages moving, with \u201csame jobs, same pay\u201d laws to increase pay for labour hours and contractors. Rather than being in a \u201ccost-of-living crisis\u201d, maybe we are actually in an \u201cinequality crisis\u201d or a \u201cmarkets charging us too much (while continuing to deliver massive profits) crisis\u201d. Or maybe we are entering a \u201cfinally taking responsibility for the way our nation functions\u201d moment. Less \u201ccost of living\u201d, more \u201cchoice of how we live together\u201d.

As this week\u2019s Guardian Essential poll illustrates, these are decisions that are now undermining the economic security of many Australian households\nIf cost of living is the question, the answer is a resounding \u201couch\u201d. One quarter of the population are doing it tough, another 40% are starting to feel the heat, leaving just a third in the comfort of the economic banana chair. This speaks to a second problem with the \u201ccost-of-living\u201d frame. It vests the challenge to find the money to pay the bills and mortgage in the individual, rather than seeing these as the inevitable consequence of turning essential services into private markets and transforming citizens into customers. As individual consumers it\u2019s on us to navigate the system, with the government\u2019s role confined to improving the flow of consumer information. Remember the Rudd government\u2019s impotent response to post-GFC rising prices with a string of price comparison websites? Finally, thinking of the current problem as a \u201ccrisis\u201d makes the moment seem transitory, more like an economic storm or bushfire to be weathered while absolving government of longer-term accountability for systemic failures. But a separate question suggests most people have not read the free market memo and expect the government to intervene with more than crisis payments and emergency accommodation.\nPeople, especially the young who are most affected by the impacts of inflation, believe government can \u2013 or more appositely could \u2013 make a difference if they chose to. It\u2019s what politicians do with that expectation that is more revealing. Ironically, for the conservative political parties that have always governed in the name of \u201cfree markets\u201d, blaming the new government for living costs requires a suspension of disbelief that not even the Murdoch echo chamber can sustain.\nThis was borne out in the Coalition\u2019s abject failure in the Aston byelection over the weekend, where the federal Coalition discovered that simply shouting \u201ccost of living\u201d is not enough to convince people you have a plan. Meanwhile in NSW, Labor\u2019s successful prosecution of the \u201ccost-of-living crisis\u201d, a key issue in winning minority government, was more a series of Band-Aids placed on existing policy wounds than transformative change. NSW Labor promised to lift the 2.5% public sector wages cap designed to peg pay claims to inflation but now delivering declining living standards to nurses, teachers and many other tens of thousands who work directly for the government. It also pledged to end the Coalition\u2019s privatisation fetish and specifically vowed to keep Sydney Water, one of the few assets that hadn\u2019t been flogged off already, in public hands. Most gallingly, it promised to redirect significant taxpayer dollars to offset the exorbitant tolls multinational corporations are charging people to get around a city too reliant on private roads. Cost of living, indeed. A final table shows there is an appetite for government to take the discussion beyond the sticker and open a more honest discussion on the very architecture of our economy.\nThese figures show the depth of public appetite for government intervention into the markets of essential services, not just at the point of sale, but at the source. Ideas that have been off the table for the best part of four decades including centrally mandated price caps on energy prices enjoy overwhelming public support. Tax cuts are also as popular as ever, highlighting the challenges in reversing even the regressive stage-three handouts to the wealthy. But it is support for systemic change that also stands out, starting with the shambolic childcare market that has placed unnecessary economic stress on young families while placing unfair barriers on women returning to paid employment. Turning this failing market into a coherent, universal early learning system will ease price pressure, increase immediate productivity and invest in kids for the long term.\nSpeaking of working, the workplace minister, Tony Burke, has recognised one of the huge drivers of cost-of-living pressure is at the input end, a bargaining system designed to minimise wages for labour and maximise profits to capital. Even before our current \u201ccrisis\u201d, the Reserve Bank was warning of the impact of artificially low wages. Now it is these same Paye wage-earners who are facing the brunt of rising prices who are being most squeezed. There is strong support in our Guardian Essential poll for Burke\u2019s endorsement of a higher minimum wage; but this is not the only work on his agenda to get wages moving, with \u201csame jobs, same pay\u201d laws to increase pay for labour hours and contractors. Rather than being in a \u201ccost-of-living crisis\u201d, maybe we are actually in an \u201cinequality crisis\u201d or a \u201cmarkets charging us too much (while continuing to deliver massive profits) crisis\u201d.

Between 2000 and 2021, annual military spending increased from $1.12trn (in 2020 dollar terms) to $2.11trn. In that time, the share of global defence spending in Asia and Oceania increased from 18% to 28%, according to data compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Growing concerns over China, whose defence spending has increased steadily for nearly three decades, has fuelled an arms race across the region, upending decades-long regional conventions and revealing several potential flashpoints. Taiwan The biggest concern about China\u2019s military expansion is how it ties in to plans to annex Taiwan. The risk of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is the highest it\u2019s been in decades, but predictions of when it might happen vary. Recently a number of senior US military leaders have offered alarmingly imminent dates including 2023, 2025 and 2027. American assessments are crucial, given it\u2019s possible the US military will help defend Taiwan against Chinese attacks, but some analysts caution that these military figures are likely exaggerating to lobby for more funding. Sources say the public predictions have frustrated Taiwan\u2019s president, who is trying to ensure people are worried enough about the China threat that they support her policies, but not so much that they give up hope. However, the scale of China\u2019s military expansion offers analysts some clues to its ambitions for Taiwan. While still spending a smaller share of its GDP on defence than the US, China\u2019s defence budget will increase by 7.2% in 2023, taking it to the highest point it\u2019s ever been. The US Department of Defense estimates that China\u2019s real military spending could be up to twice as much as the officially reported figures. In response, the defence portion of the most recent US budget has prioritised ramping up the military presence in the Indo-Pacific. This month the US also approved the potential sale of $619m in new weapons to Taiwan. Just as important as the increased spending is how it affects the balance of military strength in the region. In 2000, China was the second-largest defence spender in the Indo-Pacific. By 2021 it was spending more on defence than the next 13 countries in the region combined. China has also taken great exception to a tripartite agreement between Australia, the US and the UK. The AU$368bn deal, known as Aukus, will see the US and UK help Australia acquire at least three nuclear-powered submarines over the next three decades. Aukus is widely seen as being aimed at countering China\u2019s military expansion, and has drawn mixed reactions. China accused the allies of deception, using loopholes in non-proliferation treaties, and \u201cwalking further and further down the path of error and danger\u201d. Australia\u2019s defence minister responded by saying, \u201cChina invests \u2026 in its own defence capabilities; we are doing that in respect of ours.\u201d Helen Davidson in Taipei and Amy Hawkins North Korea Having launched about 90 ballistic missiles and other weapons in 2022 \u2013 more than in any other year \u2013 North Korea appears intent on setting a new record this year. It has held 11 rounds of missile tests, some involving more than one weapon, so far in 2023, including two intercontinental ballistic missiles and, according to state media, strategic cruise missiles with a nuclear capability. In a sign that the regime in Pyongyang has no intention of relinquishing its weapons of mass destruction, it recently unveiled new, smaller nuclear warheads and vowed to produce more weapons-grade nuclear material. Kim Jong-un called for an \u201cexponential increase\u201d in the regime\u2019s nuclear arsenal at the end of last year. The North\u2019s provocations are directed towards its nemeses: the US and South Korea. As March drew to a close, forces from both countries engaged in joint maritime exercises that included nuclear-powered aircraft carrier the USS Nimitz, days after they ended their largest joint military exercises in five years. The allies insist the drills are purely defensive in nature, but Pyongyang condemns them as a rehearsal for an invasion. Rising tensions on the Korean peninsula have triggered a hardline response from South Korea\u2019s conservative president, Yoon Suk Yeol, who has warned that Seoul will not provide a \u201csingle penny\u201d to the North as long as it continues to develop nuclear weapons. More worryingly for those eager to dial down tensions, a serious debate is unfolding over whether Seoul should acquire its own nuclear deterrent \u2013 a move a majority of South Koreans support, according to polls. In Japan, concern over North Korea and an increasingly assertive China has boosted the case for steering the country further away from its postwar \u201cpacifism.\u201d Late last year, the government of prime minister Fumio Kishida announced Japan would double defence spending to 2% of GDP by 2027, abandoning its self-imposed cap of 1% of GDP. The increasingly unstable security environment in the Asia-Pacific has been the catalyst for a long-awaited thaw in relations between Japan and South Korea \u2013 both US allies with tens of thousands of American troops based on their territory. In March, Yoon and Kishida became the first South Korean and Japanese leaders to hold bilateral talks for 12 years. Their summit in Tokyo came amid attempts to resolve disputes connected to their bitter wartime legacy, and resulted in an agreement to resume reciprocal visits and a security dialogue after a five-year hiatus. Justin McCurry in Tokyo South China Sea The South China Sea is one of the most strategically and economically important waterways in the world. It is one of the world\u2019s busiest trading routes, rich in marine life and is thought to contain significant reserves of oil and natural gas. It\u2019s also highly contested. China claims almost all of the South China Sea, with its so-called \u201cnine-dash\u201d line marking the limit of the country\u2019s claim \u2013 though an international tribunal in The Hague has rejected this. The Philippines, as well as Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have overlapping claims. The US, while not a claimant, considers the water crucial to its national interests. Under president Ferdinand Marcos, the Philippines has taken a much tougher stance on the dispute, with Manila accusing Chinese vessels of \u201caggressive actions\u201d in the South China Sea. Marcos has vowed the country \u201cwill not lose one inch\u201d of its territory, and has overseen a massive shift in foreign policy, strengthening defence ties with the US and its allies. In March the Philippines expanded US access to its military bases, enhancing Washington\u2019s footprint in the region, and enabling it to more easily monitor Chinese activity in the South China Sea near Taiwan. It has also strengthened military ties with Japan and Australia, two US allies. In contrast to neighbouring Southeast Asia countries that have expressed concerns over Aukus, which some nations fear could prompt an arms race that destabilises the region, the Philippines has supported the development. The approach taken by Marcos, who came to power last year, is a stark contrast to that of his predecessor, former president Rodrigo Duterte. Duterte had sought closer economic ties with Beijing and was reluctant to confront China over its activities in the South China sea \u2013 even as China constructed military bases on human-made islands, and Chinese vessels harassed, or rammed, Filippine boats. Rebecca Ratcliffe in Bangkok Pacific Islands Pacific leaders have repeatedly stressed that they don\u2019t want to be drawn into a geostrategic contest between the US and China, and have resisted the notion of picking a side. They have also repeatedly said the climate crisis is their top security threat. However, China is increasingly active in seeking influence among Pacific island countries, including in security and policing. These efforts have prompted something of a reckoning in Australia, New Zealand and the US, which have all moved to step up their diplomatic efforts. Beijing\u2019s progress in the region was most sharply illustrated by the signing of a security agreement with Solomon Islands nearly a year ago. A leaked draft suggested that the agreement would allow China to respond to requests from police and armed forces to carry out a range of tasks such as maintaining social order and protecting \u201cthe safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in Solomon Islands\u201d. Australian officials had privately raised fears that the deal might pave the way for a future Chinese naval presence about 1,700km from the country\u2019s coast, although the prime minister of Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, has repeatedly assured Australia and other countries that there will never be a foreign military base in his country. China also sought a sweeping regional security deal with 10 Pacific countries last year, but this was rebuffed by Pacific leaders over concerns that Beijing was trying to bypass established structures such as the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF). Other countries have scrambled to respond to China\u2019s diplomatic pursuits.

There are plenty of fresh, affordable vegetables this month, and the green brassica stands out for all the right reasons. \u201c[Broccoli] is cheap, affordable and something that most families enjoy,\u201d says George Vasilevski, the owner of Yarraville Square Fresh Market in Melbourne. \u201cYou can find a rougher-grade broccoli, which doesn\u2019t look as pretty but is just as fresh, for as little as $2 a kilo but you shouldn\u2019t be paying more than $6 a kilo for the best.\u201d In supermarkets it can be found for about $4 a kilo. Roasting is one of the best ways to cook broccoli \u2013 the high heat gives a complex, nutty savouriness to the florets and stalks. With one large batch of roasted broccoli, the chef Alex Bluett has created four recipes: a salad, a blue-cheese gratin, a soup and a toastie. If you need to be broc-convinced, the vegetable goes (almost) incognito in Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s orecchiette with broccoli and rocket. For the converted, Rachel Roddy\u2019s broccoli ripassati tossed through casarecce is the green pasta of choice. Elsewhere in the brassica family, Vasilevski says there are plenty of bargain buys this month. Cauliflowers are back, and a steal at about $2.50 to $3 each. Get ahead with Felicity Cloake\u2019s guide to cooking the perfect whole-roasted cauliflower before spinning off with Nigel Slater\u2019s roasted cauliflower with lemon harissa sauce or Meera Sodha\u2019s cumin-and-chilli-spiced number with pilaf. And let this be the season for cauliflower tacos. Kale is fresh and crisp at about $4.50 a bunch; a bunch of silverbeet will set you back about $5.50. Half savoy cabbages remain steady at about $3 each in supermarkets, while whole womboks can be found at $4.90 each and are destined for your next homemade kimchi. Keen for zucchinis April\u2019s zucchinis are gourd\u2019s gifts. Vasilevski calls them \u201cgreat value and very versatile\u201d and is selling them at $2 to $6 a kilo, depending on quality. In supermarkets, they are about $4.50 a kilo. Mattie Taiano\u2019s zucchini lasagne is meat-free; Alice Zaslavsky\u2019s zucchini fritters are gluten-free, dairy-free, egg-free and nut-free; while Aleksandar Taralezhkov has created a zucchini multiverse with Bulgarian dolma, moussaka and koftas. At the Greener Grocer in Maroubra in Sydney\u2019s east, its manager, Adam Balloot, says April is also the time to watch for grey zucchinis (often sold as Lebanese zucchinis). They are so named for their grey-coloured seeds and have a slightly sweeter flavour than green zucchinis. Red and green capsicums are abundant and can be found for $7 to $8 a kilo in supermarkets. Yellow capsicums, the sweetest of the lot, are about $12 to $13 a kilo. They\u2019re pricier because they have spent more time on the vine before harvesting. If your capsicums have spent a little too long lingering in the fridge, give them a second chance at life with Rachel Roddy\u2019s sweet and sour capsicum and potatoes. Also in stable supply are Asian greens, eggplant, corn and fennel. After a late-summer glut, it\u2019s wise to leave tomatoes off your shopping list. \u201cAbout a month ago, we were selling 1kg bags for $2.50,\u201d Balloot says. \u201cToday, we have a 1kg bag for $4.\u201d In supermarkets, most varieties have risen to $7 or $8 a kilo for loose tomatoes. \u201cIf you can get your hands on a prepacked one, that\u2019s going to be a better deal right now,\u201d Balloot says. He says avocados are \u201cstill a bit iffy\u201d and, while prices are slowly going down each week, the much-loved Hass variety is not expected to return soon. Which means now is the time to embrace Shepards. A is for April, autumn and apples Last month\u2019s picks \u2013 grapes and watermelons \u2013 remain at a good price but April is the apple\u2019s time to shine. Royal Galas are cheapest at about $3.90 a kilo, with Jazz, Kanzi and Fuji apples at about $5 a kilo. The latter variety is good for baking into these cakes, tarts and apple crumble muffins. \u201cThe most popular are Pink Ladies, but they\u2019re one of the last apples to come in. They\u2019re about a month away,\u201d Vasilevski says. Pears have also started falling in price, from about $2.90 (on special) to $5 a kilo. Combine the two autumnal fruits in Tamal Ray\u2019s apple and pear tart with a rum and star anise glaze. The recipe calls for conference pears, which can be hard to find in Australia \u2013 substitute with William Bartlett or beurre bosc. Autumn also brings persimmons. At about $3 each, they will come down in price as supply comes in, albeit for a short season. Some prefer the jammy, astringent, teardrop-shaped variety; others prefer the firm Fuyu specimens, which work well in Alanna Sapwell\u2019s persimmon tarte tatin. High on local citrus supply While vegetable supply and prices will largely remain steady, Neha Thaker, owner of Vince and Charlie\u2019s Fruit Market in Ferny Hills, north-west of Brisbane, says fruit is not as consistent in cooler months. \u201cThe new season fruit is at peak prices at the moment,\u201d she says. \u201cMandarins are coming \u2013 they\u2019re beautiful - but they\u2019re quite high in price still, like $10 a kilo.\u201d Local citrus will enter the market towards the end of April, bringing an end to imported navel oranges. They\u2019re now in supermarkets for $6 or $7 a kilo but soon customers will find premium-quality oranges for about $5 a kilo or less. We have this upside-down orange cake bookmarked, just in case. For now, berries, \u201cone of the most expensive fruits\u201d, are unlikely to come down in price and mangoes are well and truly gone. Keep the summer dream alive with good stone fruit \u2013 the last of the season \u2013 which to Thaker\u2019s surprise, are still good quality. \u201cUsually by this time, they\u2019re going black

With one large batch of roasted broccoli, the chef Alex Bluett has created four recipes: a salad, a blue-cheese gratin, a soup and a toastie.

High on local citrus supply\nWhile vegetable supply and prices will largely remain steady, Neha Thaker, owner of Vince and Charlie\u2019s Fruit Market in Ferny Hills, north-west of Brisbane, says fruit is not as consistent in cooler months. \u201cThe new season fruit is at peak prices at the moment,\u201d she says. \u201cMandarins are coming \u2013 they\u2019re beautiful - but they\u2019re quite high in price still, like $10 a kilo.\u201d Local citrus will enter the market towards the end of April, bringing an end to imported navel oranges. They\u2019re now in supermarkets for $6 or $7 a kilo but soon customers will find premium-quality oranges for about $5 a kilo or less. We have this upside-down orange cake bookmarked, just in case.\nFor now, berries, \u201cone of the most expensive fruits\u201d, are unlikely to come down in price and mangoes are well and truly gone. Keep the summer dream alive with good stone fruit \u2013 the last of the season \u2013 which to Thaker\u2019s surprise, are still good quality. \u201cUsually by this time, they\u2019re going black inside and rotting \u2026 I think customers should make the most of it.\u201d Buy: Apples Asian greens Bananas: stable year-round Broccoli Broccolini Cauliflower Cabbage Corn Eggplant Fennel Grapes Green beans Kale Lemons Lettuce Limes Pears Silverbeet Watermelon: rising in price, but still cheap Wombok Zucchini Watch: Cucumbers: rising slightly in price Persimmons: coming down in price Pomegranates: coming into season Stone fruit: at their end, so get in fast Avoid: Mangoes: gone Tomatoes: expensive Berries: expensive", "attributes": {}, "published": true, "createdDate": "2023-04-04T00:00:31Z", "firstPublishedDate": "2023-04-04T00:00:31Z", "publishedDate": "2023-04-04T00:38:47Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-04-04T00:38:45Z", "contributors": [], "elements": [{"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>April guarantees a plentiful supply of chocolate eggs, hot cross buns \u2026 and broccoli.
