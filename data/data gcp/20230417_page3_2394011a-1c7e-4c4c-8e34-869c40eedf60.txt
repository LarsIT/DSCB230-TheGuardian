Hill acted as a kind of formidable Slavic matriarch for Frayn\u2019s cohort; she addressed them \u201cGospoda!\u201d (\u201cgentlemen!\u201d), \u201ccoaxing the Russian out of you by the sheer brightness of her eyes\u201d, and they duly grew into the role.\nLike several of the friends here, Hill was characterised by brilliant longevity. The last time Frayn saw her, at 95, she was rising at six in Cambridge after a party to catch a bus to London to put in a full day\u2019s work at the British Library. She is matched for enduring eye-bright curiosity not only by Frayn himself, but in portraits of several of his closest pals: Neal Ascherson, his former Observer colleague, still writing as eruditely as ever; Michael Blakemore, the director of 10 of Frayn\u2019s plays, who revived the last of them, Copenhagen, on the eve of his own 90th birthday in 2018; and Bamber Gascoigne, who opens this book and establishes something of its presiding spirit: a golden lad at Cambridge, who remains endearingly \u201clucky and loved\u201d to his end in 2022. The brightness of some of these young things is sharpened in Frayn\u2019s memory by the close knowledge of alternative narrative arcs. There are among the success stories inevitably several tragic notes. His piece on playwright Peter Nichols feels like one; early success that trails tragedy and intermittent despair. Equally honest and poignant is Frayn\u2019s account of the bipolar extremes of the famed Observer journalist John Gale, who took his own life at 49, and of Frayn\u2019s childhood friend David, who used his imagination to escape from a tyrannical father, but was psychologically undone by that bullying decades later. As the book progresses, that sense of the precariousness of fate, of roads not taken, takes over. Frayn\u2019s discretion in excluding lost loves was finally overcome, he suggests, at the insistence of his wife, Claire Tomalin. His penultimate chapter here \u2013 before a valedictory letter to his most constant companion, his own body \u2013 is a recollection of his first overwhelming romance, with Liza Mrosovsky, whom he met in the spring of 1957, his graduation year, and with whom he spent part of a magical summer in Rome. He has kept the 56 letters she sent him during those six months of their grand affair, and reinhabits the intensity of their rise and fall together, the talk of undying love and marriage, and then not. It was he who ended things, on the brutal grounds, apparently, that she was not part of his \u201cintellectual world\u201d \u2013 can he really have offered that \u201cpompous put-down\u201d, he wonders, 65 years on? When he tries to find a trace of her, he discovers a life lived very happily without him, one that ended in 2016. He\u2019d always promised to write, he says, and now, in this poised, heartfelt book, he has fulfilled that obligation. \u2022 Among Others: Friendships and Encounters by Michael Frayn is published by Faber (\u00a325).

MJ, Monyash The ineptitude displayed by Scottish Power in handling the closure of your late father\u2019s account at times borders on parody. To send cheques to your father\u2019s female alter ego not once, but twice, as well as sending emails addressed to him, is distressing.

You are glad it is finally all over but feel that by repeating mistakes, such as issuing useless cheques to \u201cMiss AJ\u201d, it demonstrated considerable incompetence and insensitivity. It made you glad to receive an apology and a level of compensation that you think begins to reflect the seriousness of its failures in this case. To you, it seemed that Scottish Power\u2019s procedures and systems for dealing with the death of a customer had been designed with a level of incompetence comparable to Basil Fawlty.

On the basis of the statements and correspondence, Scottish Power still owes my family about \u00a3365 and I feel that some acknowledgment of its failings is warranted given the impact on me after the loss of my father. MJ, Monyash The ineptitude displayed by Scottish Power in handling the closure of your late father\u2019s account at times borders on parody. To send cheques to your father\u2019s female alter ego not once, but twice, as well as sending emails addressed to him, is distressing. But to then chase you for money that you do not owe is shocking. The good news, however, is that with our help this sorry saga is now finally over. Scottish Power says: \u201cWe\u2019re very sorry for the distress and frustration MJ experienced, and the unacceptable delays in resolving this for him at such a difficult time. This is not the standard of customer service we aim to provide.\u201d It continues: \u201cWe cancelled all previous cheques and sent him cheques issued in his name and to his address, covering the final credit balance owed. \u201cWe refunded the energy bill support payments he was entitled to for his late father\u2019s property, and remained in touch to ensure the cheques were received and cashed before closing the accounts concerned. \u201cWe then agreed and issued a goodwill payment in recognition of the distress caused.\u201d After some wrangling it increased its compensation offer to \u00a3500, which your family has accepted. You are glad it is finally all over but feel that by repeating mistakes, such as issuing useless cheques to \u201cMiss AJ\u201d, it demonstrated considerable incompetence and insensitivity. It made you glad to receive an apology and a level of compensation that you think begins to reflect the seriousness of its failures in this case. To you, it seemed that Scottish Power\u2019s procedures and systems for dealing with the death of a customer had been designed with a level of incompetence comparable to Basil Fawlty. The hope here is that by highlighting your experience, other people dealing with the loss of a loved one will have a better experience. Let\u2019s hope so.

It is a gift famously more attractive than the perennially unpopular alternative. I will turn 50 this year and I have realised that I couldn\u2019t care less if people think I am 70 or 80, let alone 50. I\u2019m just happy to be around. I don\u2019t need anyone to think I\u2019m not 50, and I certainly don\u2019t need them to believe I\u2019m any younger. What would be the point? If people think you\u2019re younger than you are (or, worse, that you \u201clook good for your age\u201d), there\u2019s a pressure there. It might be manageable this month. But how are you going to maintain that over the next five years? Or 10 years? Let\u2019s be optimistic. Better to act like you\u2019re 90 now. I mean, you might never get there in reality. So channel that age. Get the practice in.</p> <p>The thing is, we are monumentally spoilt, even with the latest alarming news of the UK\u2019s stagnant life expectancy, which is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d25b1c9-33bf-448a-bb07-6a0fc3a8a603\">slowly creeping downwards from the upper 80s</a>, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Because only 2,000 years ago, it was completely normal to expect to die a horrible death between the age of 20 and 35. Old people were outliers. It was only from around 1800 that average life expectancy in Europe pushed up to 40, and only in the past 200 years that it has moved beyond all previous imagining and we had to invent stupid sayings like \u201cAge is just a number\u201d and \u201c60 is the new 50.\u201d But if it really were just a number, then no one would need to say that it\u2019s just a number. And if it\u2019s all just numbers, then no number needs to be the new version of another number.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If success is ageless then you can pressure everyone to \u2018keep grinding\u2018 until they drop dead</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This double-think struck me in <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a43518988/pedro-pascal-the-last-of-us-interview-2023/\">the current circus surrounding actor Pedro Pascal</a>. I am a fully paid-up member of this circus, dedicated to celebrating and championing the career of my close coeval and imaginary boyfriend Pedro Pascal, break-out star of the hit TV series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/16/the-last-of-us-review-one-of-the-finest-tv-shows-you-will-see-this-year\">The Last of Us </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-mandalorian\">The Mandalorian</a>. I will happily tend the elephants in this circus, and I will do so with no requests for remuneration. However, I object to one of the circus\u2019 mantras: that Pedro Pascal\u2019s age is significant. Pascal just turned 48, and somehow this is supposed to give us all hope: that it\u2019s never too late to have a late-blooming acting career as a bounty hunter with paternal instincts, and that somehow success is \u201cageless\u201d. But Pascal is hardly late-blooming. He has been very happily having a busy and successful life in dozens of films and TV shows since his early 20s. It just so happens that the limelight of extreme, obsessive celebrity has fallen on him at this particular moment. It\u2019s not inspiring that he\u2019s old; it\u2019s just a fact and a coincidence. Success and celebrity are not \u201cageless\u201d. They are subjective and fickle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/04/carol-vorderman-60s-renaissance-political-hero\">Carol Vorderman\u2019s later-life renaissance gives us just the kind of political hero we need | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The obsession with agelessness is becoming so pervasive that people are now even embracing it before puberty. I recently boggled at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cq8SuZ2gb6r/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D\">a nine-year-old \u201cfashion influencer\u201d</a>, with more than 350,000 followers on Instagram, expressing the view that \u201cfashion has no age\u201d. I mean, who would disagree? But how convenient. If fashion is ageless then you can market to consumers from the moment they exit the womb. If success is ageless then you can pressure everyone to \u201ckeep grinding\u201d until they drop dead. Far more liberating? Just be old and cheerfully weary and do things in the manner of an old, cheerfully weary person. We need to see all kinds of people represented in society, and the way things are going, even with the life expectancy wobble, there are only going to be more of the old and cheerfully weary around.</p> <p>We feel obliged to bang on repeatedly about the fact that ageing doesn\u2019t matter. But, the fact is, if age really had no meaning then: (a) we would not bang on about it not mattering, because when things really don\u2019t matter they don\u2019t get mentioned, and (b) digital algorithms would not repeatedly segment us according to our date of birth.

I will turn 50 this year and I have realised that I couldn\u2019t care less if people think I am 70 or 80, let alone 50. I\u2019m just happy to be around. I don\u2019t need anyone to think I\u2019m not 50, and I certainly don\u2019t need them to believe I\u2019m any younger. What would be the point? If people think you\u2019re younger than you are (or, worse, that you \u201clook good for your age\u201d), there\u2019s a pressure there. It might be manageable this month. But how are you going to maintain that over the next five years? Or 10 years? Let\u2019s be optimistic. Better to act like you\u2019re 90 now. I mean, you might never get there in reality. So channel that age. Get the practice in. The thing is, we are monumentally spoilt, even with the latest alarming news of the UK\u2019s stagnant life expectancy, which is slowly creeping downwards from the upper 80s, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Because only 2,000 years ago, it was completely normal to expect to die a horrible death between the age of 20 and 35. Old people were outliers. It was only from around 1800 that average life expectancy in Europe pushed up to 40, and only in the past 200 years that it has moved beyond all previous imagining and we had to invent stupid sayings like \u201cAge is just a number\u201d and \u201c60 is the new 50.\u201d But if it really were just a number, then no one would need to say that it\u2019s just a number. And if it\u2019s all just numbers, then no number needs to be the new version of another number. This double-think struck me in the current circus surrounding actor Pedro Pascal. I am a fully paid-up member of this circus, dedicated to celebrating and championing the career of my close coeval and imaginary boyfriend Pedro Pascal, break-out star of the hit TV series The Last of Us and The Mandalorian. I will happily tend the elephants in this circus, and I will do so with no requests for remuneration. However, I object to one of the circus\u2019 mantras: that Pedro Pascal\u2019s age is significant. Pascal just turned 48, and somehow this is supposed to give us all hope: that it\u2019s never too late to have a late-blooming acting career as a bounty hunter with paternal instincts, and that somehow success is \u201cageless\u201d. But Pascal is hardly late-blooming. He has been very happily having a busy and successful life in dozens of films and TV shows since his early 20s. It just so happens that the limelight of extreme, obsessive celebrity has fallen on him at this particular moment. It\u2019s not inspiring that he\u2019s old; it\u2019s just a fact and a coincidence. Success and celebrity are not \u201cageless\u201d. They are subjective and fickle. The obsession with agelessness is becoming so pervasive that people are now even embracing it before puberty. I recently boggled at a nine-year-old \u201cfashion influencer\u201d, with more than 350,000 followers on Instagram, expressing the view that \u201cfashion has no age\u201d. I mean, who would disagree? But how convenient. If fashion is ageless then you can market to consumers from the moment they exit the womb. If success is ageless then you can pressure everyone to \u201ckeep grinding\u201d until they drop dead. Far more liberating? Just be old and cheerfully weary and do things in the manner of an old, cheerfully weary person. We need to see all kinds of people represented in society, and the way things are going, even with the life expectancy wobble, there are only going to be more of the old and cheerfully weary around. We feel obliged to bang on repeatedly about the fact that ageing doesn\u2019t matter. But, the fact is, if age really had no meaning then: (a) we would not bang on about it not mattering, because when things really don\u2019t matter they don\u2019t get mentioned, and (b) digital algorithms would not repeatedly segment us according to our date of birth. The algorithm knows the truth: we\u2019re not getting any younger.

Pascal just turned 48, and somehow this is supposed to give us all hope: that it\u2019s never too late to have a late-blooming acting career as a bounty hunter with paternal instincts, and that somehow success is \u201cageless\u201d. But Pascal is hardly late-blooming. He has been very happily having a busy and successful life in dozens of films and TV shows since his early 20s. It just so happens that the limelight of extreme, obsessive celebrity has fallen on him at this particular moment. It\u2019s not inspiring that he\u2019s old; it\u2019s just a fact and a coincidence. Success and celebrity are not \u201cageless\u201d. They are subjective and fickle.</p>"}}, {"type": "rich-link", "assets": [], "richLinkTypeData": {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/04/carol-vorderman-60s-renaissance-political-hero", "originalUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/04/carol-vorderman-60s-renaissance-political-hero", "linkText": "Carol Vorderman\u2019s later-life renaissance gives us just the kind of political hero we need | Gaby Hinsliff", "linkPrefix": "Related: ", "role": "thumbnail"}}, {"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>The obsession with agelessness is becoming so pervasive that people are now even embracing it before puberty.

I mean, who would disagree? But how convenient. If fashion is ageless then you can market to consumers from the moment they exit the womb. If success is ageless then you can pressure everyone to \u201ckeep grinding\u201d until they drop dead. Far more liberating? Just be old and cheerfully weary and do things in the manner of an old, cheerfully weary person. We need to see all kinds of people represented in society, and the way things are going, even with the life expectancy wobble, there are only going to be more of the old and cheerfully weary around.</p> \n<p>We feel obliged to bang on repeatedly about the fact that ageing doesn\u2019t matter. But, the fact is, if age really had no meaning then: (a) we would not bang on about it not mattering, because when things really don\u2019t matter they don\u2019t get mentioned, and (b) digital algorithms would not repeatedly segment us according to our date of birth.

Doctors in Brighton, says. \u201cThat is ultimately what guides us in terms of recommending what a person wants to buy.\u201d</p> <p>Webster says there are three main categories \u2013 general family use, professional use and gaming. For a family device, a Chromebook may suffice \u2013 and with models below \u00a3300, these will usually cost less than a Windows laptop. \u201cThe Chromebook is a very distinct environment.

It\u2019s a straightforward, simplified way of doing things.\u201d</p> <p>For professional use, Webster says, \u201cwe will be steering them towards Windows computers with an Intel-based central processing unit (CPU).\u201d Broadly speaking, an Intel Core i5 CPU is a minimum, with i7 as a better (though more expensive) option, as it gives \u201clongevity and the best value for money\u201d.

But people buy one thinking they\u2019ll be able to use Spotify or to go on the internet, and it\u2019s just not designed for that.

You could accept an i3 processor for extremely light use; i5 is middling; i7 and above are really good \u2013 and they will run Windows 11.\u201d</p> <p>To avoid a false economy and a lot of frustration, Dutch recommends looking for models that have Intel i3 or AMD Ryzen 3, a minimum 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB hard drive.

It will make it quicker, more usable, more responsive \u2013 that\u2019s a really good upgrade.

It\u2019s a straightforward, simplified way of doing things.\u201d</p> \n<p>For professional use, Webster says, \u201cwe will be steering them towards Windows computers with an Intel-based central processing unit (CPU).\u201d Broadly speaking, an Intel Core i5 CPU is a minimum, with i7 as a better (though more expensive) option, as it gives \u201clongevity and the best value for money\u201d.

It will make it quicker, more usable, more responsive \u2013 that\u2019s a really good upgrade. And that starts at about \u00a399,\u201d Dutch says. \u201cAnd if someone has cracked a screen, you can replace it from about \u00a3109.\u201d</p>"}}]}], "totalBodyBlocks": 1}, "rights": {"syndicatable": "true", "subscriptionDatabases": "true", "developerCommunity": "true"}, "section": {"id": "money", "webTitle": "Money", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/money", "editions": [{"id": "money", "webTitle": "Money", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/money", "code": "default"}, {"id": "uk/money", "webTitle": "Money", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/money", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/money", "code": "uk"}, {"id": "us/money", "webTitle": "Money", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us/money", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/us/money", "code": "us"}, {"id": "au/money", "webTitle": "Money", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/au/money", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/au/money", "code": "au"}]}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "technology/2023/apr/17/philips-hue-go-table-lamp-review-battery-powered-smart-light-for-indoors-or-out", "type": "article", "sectionId": "technology", "sectionName": "Technology", "webPublicationDate": "2023-04-17T06:00:31Z", "webTitle": "Philips Hue Go table lamp review: battery-powered smart light for indoors or out", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/17/philips-hue-go-table-lamp-review-battery-powered-smart-light-for-indoors-or-out", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/apr/17/philips-hue-go-table-lamp-review-battery-powered-smart-light-for-indoors-or-out", "fields": {"headline": "Philips Hue Go table lamp review: battery-powered smart light for indoors or out", "standfirst": "<p>Rechargeable, water-resistant lamp you can pick up and take into the garden</p>", "trailText": "Rechargeable, water-resistant lamp you can pick up and take into the garden", "byline": "Samuel Gibbs Consumer technology editor", "main": "<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e1129b33f8038a7d1dac07793a38d07ebaeaed5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e1129b33f8038a7d1dac07793a38d07ebaeaed5/118_418_5206_3124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philips Hue Go table lamp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Philips Hue Go has a colour-changing bulb that looks great on a side table or for alfresco dining.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>", "body": "<p>The latest Philips Hue Go smart light aims to be a great indoor table lamp that you can just pick up and head out into the garden with for impromptu illumination wherever you need it.</p> <p>It costs \u00a3140 ($160), which makes it fairly expensive for a rechargeable lamp, although in line with fancier designs.

It costs \u00a3140 ($160), which makes it fairly expensive for a rechargeable lamp, although in line with fancier designs. It joins the smaller, dish-shaped \u00a380 Hue Go in the company\u2019s portable lineup. What sets the Go table lamp apart is its integration with the rest of the Hue smart light system, behaving like a small regular table lamp until you pick it up from its charging base. It has a minimalist aesthetic, made of metal with a reassuring heft. It has a removable rubber grip on the shaft and is splash-resistant in case it rains. The lamp has a colour-changing LED that shines downwards from the solid shade, providing a nice ambient or accent light. It shines at 370 lumens when turned on, which is the equivalent of a 4W LED or 25W tungsten bulb, but hits 530 lumens (6W LED, 35W tungsten) at its brightest setting. That\u2019s enough to illuminate a small table, making it ideal for alfresco dining. Full controls including brightness and a spectrum of colours are available through the Hue Android or iPhone app. The lamp can be used on its own, controlled via Bluetooth from the phone. But it is best when connected to the Hue Bridge and grouped with other smart lights for various fancy features such as schedules and automations, party modes and voice control via smart speakers. Specifications Dimensions 35 x 14.2cm Weight 973g Water resistance IP54 (splash) Connectivity Hue bridge and Bluetooth Max brightness 530 lumens Battery life 5-48 hours, depending on brightness When used on its little circular power base, the lamp draws electricity straight from the mains, bypassing the battery to avoid it wearing out. Pick the lamp up and it switches to battery power, lasting up to 48 hours at its dimmest setting or about five at its brightest. That\u2019s long enough for most outdoor evenings in the summer, but it isn\u2019t the kind of lamp you\u2019d take on a camping trip. I put it in the middle of the table for a dinner party in winter, synched it to Spotify for some music-linked lighting effects, and used it to light a night of cards, all of which worked very well. The one thing you can\u2019t do is see how long is left on the battery, which seems like an oversight. A full charge of the battery takes about four hours. Sustainability Philips Hue\u2019s parent company, Signify, rates the battery in the lamp for at least 800 full charge cycles, with at least 80% of its original capacity and the bulb for at least 20,000 hours or at least five years of typical use. The battery can be removed, but replacement options are not yet available. When used on the base, the lamp is lit directly from the mains, bypassing the battery and prolonging its life. The company commits to a minimum of five years of software support, but has a track record of much longer. Signify publishes annual sustainability reports.

Dowdell was within weeks of graduation and faced a bright future, Hayes told the Associated Press.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was a strong competitor on the field,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to try to tackle him or get tackled by him. But when he came off the field, he was one of the nicest young men that you could ever meet, very respectful and well respected by his peers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hayes said worried families swarmed the local hospital on Saturday night trying to find the condition of their children. He said serious crime was rare in Dadeville, and the small city was \u201csad, traumatized, in shock\u201d.</p> \n<p>This is at least the second time in recent years that multiple people were shot in Dadeville.

More than 28 people were injured, some critically, during the shooting about 60 miles (100km) north-east of the state capital of Montgomery, authorities said. The shooting started shortly after 10.30pm on Saturday. Law enforcement officers did not immediately say if a suspect was in custody or if investigators knew about any motivation. The police called for people to come forward with information. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to work in a very methodical way to go through this scene, to look at the facts, and ensure that justice is brought to bear for the families,\u201d said Jeremy Burkett, a sergeant with the Alabama law enforcement agency, during a news conference on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have information from the community,\u201d Burkett said during a Sunday evening news conference. President Joe Biden said in a statement on Sunday: \u201cWhat has our nation come to when children cannot attend a birthday party without fear?\u201d Biden called the rising gun violence in the US \u201coutrageous and unacceptable\u201d, and urged Congress to pass laws that would make firearms manufacturers more liable for gun violence, ban assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, and require safe storage of firearms and background checks for gun sales. Philstavious \u201cPhil\u201d Dowdell, a Dadeville high school senior who had signed with Jacksonville State University, was celebrating at his sister Alexis\u2019s party before he was fatally shot, his grandmother Annette Allen told the Montgomery Advertiser. \u201cHe was a very, very humble child. Never messed with anybody. Always had a smile on his face,\u201d Allen told the newspaper, calling it \u201ca million-dollar smile\u201d. Dowdell\u2019s mother was among those hurt in the shooting. \u201cEverybody\u2019s grieving,\u201d Allen said. Pastor Ben Hayes, who serves as the chaplain for the Dadeville police department and for the local high school football team, said most of the victims were teenagers. Dowdell was within weeks of graduation and faced a bright future, Hayes told the Associated Press. \u201cHe was a strong competitor on the field,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to try to tackle him or get tackled by him. But when he came off the field, he was one of the nicest young men that you could ever meet, very respectful and well respected by his peers.\u201d Hayes said worried families swarmed the local hospital on Saturday night trying to find the condition of their children. He said serious crime was rare in Dadeville, and the small city was \u201csad, traumatized, in shock\u201d. This is at least the second time in recent years that multiple people were shot in Dadeville. Five people were wounded in July 2016 during a shooting at an American Legion hall, and a man was later charged with five counts of attempted murder, news outlets reported. Investigators believed an altercation led to the shooting at the Mahogany Masterpiece studio, WRBL reported. Jonathan Floyd, chief of the Dadeville police, said at a news conference: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve dealt with is something that no community should have to endure. I just ask for your patience. It\u2019s going to be a long process, but I do earnestly solicit your prayers.\u201d More than 12 hours after the shooting, investigators continued filing in and out of the Mahogany Masterpiece dance studio on Sunday. City and county officials milled about the Tallapoosa county courthouse less than a block away, where officials lowered the American and Alabama flags to half-staff. \u201cThis morning, I grieve with the people of Dadeville and my fellow Alabamians,\u201d Kay Ivey, the governor of Alabama, said on Twitter. \u201cViolent crime has NO place in our state, and we are staying closely updated by law enforcement as details emerge.\u201d In 2022 Ivey signed a bill into law that ended the requirement for a person to obtain a permit to legally carry a concealed handgun in public. The National Rifle Association (NRA) had lobbied for it. In an ad for her re-election campaign last year, Ivey was shown withdrawing a handgun from her purse as she touted her gun-friendly approach, describing the second amendment as \u201csacred\u201d. Alabama has the third-highest rate of gun deaths in the US, according to a 2020 report by Everytown, an organization that works to improve gun safety and end gun violence. Biden asked what was wrong \u201cwhen parents have to worry every time their kids walk out the door to school, to the movie theater, or to the park? Guns are the leading killer of children in America, and the numbers are rising \u2013 not declining. This is outrageous and unacceptable.\u201d Biden called on Congress to \u201crequire safe storage of firearms, require background checks for all gun sales, eliminate gun manufacturers\u2019 immunity from liability, and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines\u201d. The latest shooting comes as two people were killed in a shooting in Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday night, days after a gunman shot and killed five people in the city. Associated Press reported that an unidentified suspect fired a gun into a crowd of hundreds in Chickasaw Park in Louisville, killing two people and wounding four others. On Monday five people were killed when a man opened fire with an assault-style rifle at the Louisville bank where he worked.

Water has always been a problem at Modogashe hospital, which is located along a dusty, windy road. But the situation has got much worse over the past three years as the nearby rivers that provided it with some water have dried up. It is now reliant on water being delivered by road \u2013 which can be infrequent because there are not enough trucks. Lack of water and electricity has already forced the hospital to close its operating theatre and neonatal unit. Usuba Hussein, 20, brought her baby to the hospital because she was malnourished. Hussein fetches a 20-litre barrel of water from the hospital storage tank and uses her feet to shuffle it back to the ward. \u201cThis water needs to last me and my baby for four days,\u201d she says. That includes drinking and washing. \u201cThings have gone from bad to worse,\u201d says Njoki. \u201cI stay because it\u2019s very difficult to move elsewhere when you\u2019re employed by the government, so I can only wait for retirement.\u201d In the maternity ward, Athar Khalif, 22, lies on a bed recovering. She gave birth to her daughter on her way here. She wanted to be at the hospital because she bled heavily last time she had a baby and needed to be near trained medics. But she had to wait for a water truck to arrive at home. Women giving birth at Modogashe hospital usually bring a jerrycan of water with them, because the facility will probably not have enough. In times of extreme water shortages, like now, health workers ask mothers help out. \u201cI was rushing with my children to get water, then I felt some sharp pains. I knew I wouldn\u2019t get to the hospital in time,\u201d says Khalif. With no water, Njoki has sometimes had to use saline solutions from IV drips to stop infections during deliveries and manage postpartum haemorrhage, the leading cause of maternal deaths. Garissa County has the highest maternal mortality rate in the country: 641 deaths for every 100,000 live births, according to 2019 data by Kenya\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics. \u201cPut yourself in that situation,\u201d says Njoki. \u201cThere\u2019s no water, the mother is bleeding, and you are there and have to do something. Sometimes you have two deliveries without water and a third one on the way. Your only aim is to see the mother and the child alive.\u201d Mohamed Abdullahi, the chief of Unicef\u2019s Garissa office, says many hospitals in the area are operating under conditions that place patients at risk. \u201cThey may be admitted with one issue but pick up an infection while being treated,\u201d he says. Modogashe has had to cancel some of its critical outreach work because nearly half the community health volunteers who run the programme have left because of drought, leaving the service overstretched. \u201cThings are really bad,\u201d says Mohammed Sede Dif, 60, a community health worker. \u201cMany [volunteers] have moved to other places. When it rains, they\u2019ll come back, but for now, there\u2019s a big problem. There are so many households that need us and just a few of us left. We receive one call from this side, and another call from the other, so we do what we can but we can\u2019t respond to everything.\u201d Many of the people who have left the countryside have gone to Garissa town, about 150km (90 miles) south of Lagdera. The town\u2019s three hospitals have reported an increase in patient numbers in recent months, but at least the facilities have underground boreholes, running water and storage facilities \u2013 for now. Unicef said about 3,000 men, women and children have arrived in the town this year from Wajir, another northern region severely affected by the drought. The UN agency estimates that about 80% were unwell or had injuries when they arrived. \u201cWe are now seeing internally displaced people within Kenya for the first time in this crisis,\u201d says Abdullahi. \u201cThis is placing an enormous pressure on hospitals in the main towns in drought-affected regions, which are responding to influxes of patients from a widening area.\u201d At Garissa town\u2019s Iftin hospital, the waiting areas are full and workers bustle around the corridors. A line of patients wait outside the malnutrition centre. \u201cResources are getting finished earlier than expected \u2013 we are really feeling the pinch,\u201d says Bishar Hassan, the hospital chief. \u201cFor now we are able to handle it, but we are concerned that the cases of waterborne diseases may flare up.\u201d Garissa is still battling a cholera outbreak, which began in October, trigged by the severe drought. The World Health Organization says 7,800 cases have been recorded in the country. Kenya\u2019s Ministry of Health has launched an oral vaccine campaign to reach 2.2 million people. Unicef has also rehabilitated 21 boreholes in Garissa and begun prospecting for underground water sources in a number of northern counties. This involves using specialist equipment to more accurately track where water might be found and improve drilling rates. \u201cThe key is to build the capacity of county governments to manage scarce water resources in ways that suit the environment and climate,\u201d says Abdullahi. \u201cThe anticipation of future needs is vital.\u201d", "charCount": "6022", "shouldHideReaderRevenue": "false",

Most of the rooms opening on to its narrow hallway are empty. \u201cWe don\u2019t get that many patients these days,\u201d says Saveria Njoki, the head of nursing. Only three patients were on the ward that day, and none would be staying very long. According to a local official, patient numbers in Lagdera \u2013 a district in Garissa County, in the east of Kenya \u2013 have dropped from nearly 12,000 in 2019 to just over 8,000 last year, as people move away in search of water. Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia are experiencing their worst drought in 40 years, with their sixth consecutive failed rainy season. The number of people in Kenya facing severe hunger is expected to rise to 5.4 million this year, particularly in the north of the country, where about 95% of surface water sources have dried up. Garissa County is among the worst-hit regions and hordes of people have moved from the countryside to Garissa town, which sits on the Tana River.\nWater has always been a problem at Modogashe hospital, which is located along a dusty, windy road. But the situation has got much worse over the past three years as the nearby rivers that provided it with some water have dried up. It is now reliant on water being delivered by road \u2013 which can be infrequent because there are not enough trucks. Lack of water and electricity has already forced the hospital to close its operating theatre and neonatal unit. Usuba Hussein, 20, brought her baby to the hospital because she was malnourished. Hussein fetches a 20-litre barrel of water from the hospital storage tank and uses her feet to shuffle it back to the ward. \u201cThis water needs to last me and my baby for four days,\u201d she says. That includes drinking and washing. \u201cThings have gone from bad to worse,\u201d says Njoki. \u201cI stay because it\u2019s very difficult to move elsewhere when you\u2019re employed by the government, so I can only wait for retirement.\u201d\nIn the maternity ward, Athar Khalif, 22, lies on a bed recovering. She gave birth to her daughter on her way here. She wanted to be at the hospital because she bled heavily last time she had a baby and needed to be near trained medics. But she had to wait for a water truck to arrive at home. Women giving birth at Modogashe hospital usually bring a jerrycan of water with them, because the facility will probably not have enough.\nIn times of extreme water shortages, like now, health workers ask mothers help out. \u201cI was rushing with my children to get water, then I felt some sharp pains. I knew I wouldn\u2019t get to the hospital in time,\u201d says Khalif. With no water, Njoki has sometimes had to use saline solutions from IV drips to stop infections during deliveries and manage postpartum haemorrhage, the leading cause of maternal deaths. Garissa County has the highest maternal mortality rate in the country: 641 deaths for every 100,000 live births, according to 2019 data by Kenya\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics. \u201cPut yourself in that situation,\u201d says Njoki. \u201cThere\u2019s no water, the mother is bleeding, and you are there and have to do something. Sometimes you have two deliveries without water and a third one on the way. Your only aim is to see the mother and the child alive.\u201d\nMohamed Abdullahi, the chief of Unicef\u2019s Garissa office, says many hospitals in the area are operating under conditions that place patients at risk. \u201cThey may be admitted with one issue but pick up an infection while being treated,\u201d he says. Modogashe has had to cancel some of its critical outreach work because nearly half the community health volunteers who run the programme have left because of drought, leaving the service overstretched. \u201cThings are really bad,\u201d says Mohammed Sede Dif, 60, a community health worker. \u201cMany [volunteers] have moved to other places. When it rains, they\u2019ll come back, but for now, there\u2019s a big problem. There are so many households that need us and just a few of us left. We receive one call from this side, and another call from the other, so we do what we can but we can\u2019t respond to everything.\u201d\nMany of the people who have left the countryside have gone to Garissa town, about 150km (90 miles) south of Lagdera. The town\u2019s three hospitals have reported an increase in patient numbers in recent months, but at least the facilities have underground boreholes, running water and storage facilities \u2013 for now. Unicef said about 3,000 men, women and children have arrived in the town this year from Wajir, another northern region severely affected by the drought. The UN agency estimates that about 80% were unwell or had injuries when they arrived. \u201cWe are now seeing internally displaced people within Kenya for the first time in this crisis,\u201d says Abdullahi. \u201cThis is placing an enormous pressure on hospitals in the main towns in drought-affected regions, which are responding to influxes of patients from a widening area.\u201d\nAt Garissa town\u2019s Iftin hospital, the waiting areas are full and workers bustle around the corridors.

The World Health Organization says 7,800 cases have been recorded in the country. Kenya\u2019s Ministry of Health has launched an oral vaccine campaign to reach 2.2 million people.\nUnicef has also rehabilitated 21 boreholes in Garissa and begun prospecting for underground water sources in a number of northern counties.

Both sources said it is expected the brakes will be slammed on major infrastructure projects, singling out the Geelong Fast Rail and Melbourne Airport Rail. It follows reports the New South Wales government is also considering pausing projects due to cost blowouts. According to Treasury\u2019s pre-election budget update, Victoria\u2019s net debt is forecast to surge from $116bn in 2022-23 to $166bn by 2025-26, which is equivalent to 26.5% of gross state product. Interest payments on state debt was forecast to total $7.5bn in 2025-26, up from $3.9bn in 2022-23.

Beyond that, it will have to have some very difficult measures within it because for the best of reasons at the worst of times, we went and borrowed billions and billions of dollars to get us through a one-in-100-year event,\u201d Andrews said on Sunday. \u201cWe need to make some really difficult choices.\u201d Almost $672m was allocated to the Melbourne Airport rail project in last year\u2019s state budget for early works, as part of a $5bn commitment that was matched by the federal government. A further $123m was allocated to the Geelong Fast Rail, of which the state and federal governments have committed $2bn each. The latter was announced by the then prime minister, Scott Morrison, on the eve of the 2019 election, but it is not known how much the Albanese government intends to contribute to the project. On Monday the state\u2019s transport infrastructure minister, Jacinta Allan, said the two governments were \u201cstill in the process of making final decisions\u201d on the projects, but that there was \u201csignificant pressure\u201d on meeting the 2029 deadline for Melbourne Airport Rail. She said if there were \u201cchanges\u201d to projects, it was her expectation any federal funds would \u201cstay within Victoria\u201d. Guardian Australia also understands the secretary of the Department of Treasury and Finance, David Martine, has written to other department heads ordering them to detail plans to cut their budgets by 10% without harming \u201cfrontline services\u201d. The Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) estimates this could lead to 6,000 job cuts. \u201cIt insults people\u2019s intelligence to play this frontline versus others game as if there\u2019s some second-class job that can be cut because it\u2019s in a supporting role to others that directly deliver the service,\u201d the CPSU\u2019s Victorian secretary, Karen Batt, told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt means government will exempt every politically sensitive area but they\u2019ll impose the cut in the support roles, which wipes out the service delivery anyway as more so-called \u2018frontliners\u2019 spend more time doing those support roles.\u201d The government is expected to spend about $33.5bn on wages this financial year, the equivalent of about 40% of its revenue. The government has also flagged changes to the state\u2019s Workcover scheme, given benefits paid to injured workers exceed the premiums paid by business to fund the scheme by about $1.1bn a year.

</figure>", "body": "<p>One in eight Britons have paid for private health services in the last year, amid frustration with delays in getting NHS treatment and a growing willingness to buy care using salary or savings.</p> <p>New research by YouGov found that another 27% of people had considered going private, for themselves or a loved one, but decided against it, often because they couldn\u2019t afford it.</p> <p>Added to the 13% who did pay for care for themselves or someone they live with, that means that two in five people have either resorted to using medical care at private clinics and hospitals or thought about doing so.</p> <p>NHS campaigners said they feared that the findings show that it is becoming a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d health service and blamed underfunding and staff shortages for leaving it unable to provide timely care.</p> <p>\u201cWorsening NHS services related directly to a lack of planning, workforce shortages and underinvestment inevitably force some patients to seek care faster from the private sector,\u201d said Dr John Puntis, a retired consultant paediatrician who is the co-chair of the campaign group Keep Our NHS Public.</p> <p>\u201cThis option is available to those who can afford to pay, but excludes the vast majority of the population as over a third of people in the UK have less than \u00a31,000 in cash to cover unexpected

representative sample of 1,164 Britons found that:</p> <ul> <li><p>33% of those who had used private healthcare instead of the NHS had done so for the first time.</p></li> <li><p>53% went private \u201cso I could be seen more quickly\u201d.</p></li> <li><p>most (48%) paid for non-urgent care, such as a diagnostic test or operation.</p></li> </ul> <p>Among the 13% who had paid for private care, 29% had used disposable income but others had used a work-based private health scheme (25%), savings (24%), private medical insurance (14%) or money they had borrowed from friends of family (6%).</p> <p>The body that represents private health firms said that YouGov\u2019s findings may show that, with NHS delays so common, use of services run by such providers is becoming normalised.</p> <p>\u201cPeople feel the independent sector can help them, and we could be seeing the beginning of a significant behavioural shift with people feeling it\u2019s perfectly normal and sensible to use private healthcare when they need it, in addition to, or separate from, their NHS care\u201d, said David Hare, the chief executive of the Independent Healthcare Provider Network.</p> <p>The \u201crelatively modest\u201d average \u00a3500 spend \u201cdemonstrates that private healthcare is an option for smaller procedures, consultations, scans or diagnostics, so it\u2019s not just about significant surgical operations \u2013 and may be more affordable than people assume\u201d, Hare added.</p> <p>The findings come as the \u201celective recovery taskforce\u201d that Rishi Sunak set up to tackle the 7.2m-strong backlog of people in England awaiting hospital care is reportedly finalising plans to give patients greater choice in where they have their care, paid for by the NHS. The move is likely to lead to the private sector treating more NHS-funded patients.</p> <p>In a hint of its recommendations, the prime minister said recently that: \u201cWe should be using the independent sector to provide choice, to provide competition, drive up quality. It\u2019s worked in the past and we are going to do more of that going forward.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2023-04-14-05:13:52/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Bar chart: how people paid for private healthcare\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2023-04-14-05:13:52/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Tom Powell, YouGov\u2019s research director, said: \u201cLooking at the 13% who used private healthcare in the last year for either themselves or another member of their household, 33% of this group said it was the first time they used private healthcare rather than using the NHS.

New research by YouGov found that another 27% of people had considered going private, for themselves or a loved one, but decided against it, often because they couldn\u2019t afford it. Added to the 13% who did pay for care for themselves or someone they live with, that means that two in five people have either resorted to using medical care at private clinics and hospitals or thought about doing so. NHS campaigners said they feared that the findings show that it is becoming a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d health service and blamed underfunding and staff shortages for leaving it unable to provide timely care. \u201cWorsening NHS services related directly to a lack of planning, workforce shortages and underinvestment inevitably force some patients to seek care faster from the private sector,\u201d said Dr John Puntis, a retired consultant paediatrician who is the co-chair of the campaign group Keep Our NHS Public. \u201cThis option is available to those who can afford to pay, but excludes the vast majority of the population as over a third of people in the UK have less than \u00a31,000 in cash to cover unexpected expenses, thereby increasing health inequalities,\u201d he added. YouGov\u2019s survey of a representative sample of 1,164 Britons found that: 33% of those who had used private healthcare instead of the NHS had done so for the first time. 53% went private \u201cso I could be seen more quickly\u201d. most (48%) paid for non-urgent care, such as a diagnostic test or operation. Among the 13% who had paid for private care, 29% had used disposable income but others had used a work-based private health scheme (25%), savings (24%), private medical insurance (14%) or money they had borrowed from friends of family (6%). The body that represents private health firms said that YouGov\u2019s findings may show that, with NHS delays so common, use of services run by such providers is becoming normalised. \u201cPeople feel the independent sector can help them, and we could be seeing the beginning of a significant behavioural shift with people feeling it\u2019s perfectly normal and sensible to use private healthcare when they need it, in addition to, or separate from, their NHS care\u201d, said David Hare, the chief executive of the Independent Healthcare Provider Network. The \u201crelatively modest\u201d average \u00a3500 spend \u201cdemonstrates that private healthcare is an option for smaller procedures, consultations, scans or diagnostics, so it\u2019s not just about significant surgical operations \u2013 and may be more affordable than people assume\u201d, Hare added. The findings come as the \u201celective recovery taskforce\u201d that Rishi Sunak set up to tackle the 7.2m-strong backlog of people in England awaiting hospital care is reportedly finalising plans to give patients greater choice in where they have their care, paid for by the NHS. The move is likely to lead to the private sector treating more NHS-funded patients. In a hint of its recommendations, the prime minister said recently that: \u201cWe should be using the independent sector to provide choice, to provide competition, drive up quality. It\u2019s worked in the past and we are going to do more of that going forward.\u201d Tom Powell, YouGov\u2019s research director, said: \u201cLooking at the 13% who used private healthcare in the last year for either themselves or another member of their household, 33% of this group said it was the first time they used private healthcare rather than using the NHS. A further 48% said it wasn\u2019t the first time they used private but typically they would use the NHS. \u201cThis means that around eight in 10 of those who used private healthcare last year were people who previously would have always or typically used the NHS.\u201d Among those who paid, the average spend was \u00a3500. However, 23% had spent between \u00a31,001 and \u00a35,000 while another 4% had spent between \u00a35,001 and \u00a310,000. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThe NHS is working hard to cut waiting lists and we are making progress on our elective recovery plan, despite winter pressures on the NHS and industrial action. \u201cThe longest waits for treatment have fallen for the third month in a row and there were a record 2.1m diagnostic tests carried out in January thanks to our 100 community diagnostic centres, which have delivered over 3.4m tests, checks and scans in total.\u201d The NHS is spending at least \u00a361m a year on private ambulance services to attend emergencies such as car crashes and heart attacks in England because it cannot answer all 999 calls itself, new research by the union Unison found.

This decade has been defined so far by physical and psychological challenges. Last year, as well as the SAS show, she climbed Mont Blanc. About a year ago, for the first time, she started having therapy (even when she had a breakdown in her 20s, she powered through without professional help). \u201cI\u2019ve realised I\u2019ve done bloody marvellous without it, but sometimes things trigger and all those childhood years can come back to haunt you,\u201d she says.</p> <p>As a baby, Whitbread was abandoned in a flat in London and essentially left to die. After hearing her cries, neighbours called the police. Whitbread recovered in hospital from malnutrition, dehydration and her terrible physical condition, then spent her childhood in children\u2019s homes. \u201cI felt this deep sense of loss within me,\u201d she says. When she was five, she was introduced to her biological mother \u2013 having had no idea of her history \u2013 and moved to a children\u2019s home in Essex, where she had two half-siblings. \u201cThat was the first time I started questioning what was going on in my life and what was to become of me.\u201d</p> <p>It was a life of deprivation, physical and emotional. There wasn\u2019t enough food and they had few clothes. The children played in a cold garage with a concrete floor. Love and affection were scant. She was abandoned again and again. Occasionally, her biological mother would arrive to take her half-siblings home for a visit, but not Whitbread. Once, the woman she calls \u201cthe biological mother\u201d, never \u201cmy biological mother\u201d \u2013 a Turkish Cypriot woman who spoke almost no English \u2013 did take her, but changed her mind and sent her back to the home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"390a076b008f699e8a019067d827428272c5a82b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/390a076b008f699e8a019067d827428272c5a82b/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fatima Whitbread with Ferne McCann on Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins in 2022\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Whitbread with Ferne McCann on Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins in 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Dadds/Channel 4/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whitbread\u2019s biological father, a Greek Cypriot, also surfaced. She spent a week with him, with the promise that he would be back to collect her again the weekend after, but he didn\u2019t appear. \u201cI sat on the front wall for a whole weekend,\u201d she says. \u201cThe second weekend, I did the same thing. I think that cracked me, emotionally. I put these walls up around myself to secure me.\u201d</p> <p>The only person who showed Whitbread any love was a woman who worked in the home, known as Auntie Rae. It was Rae who stopped Whitbread\u2019s biological mother, who arrived one day with three men, from taking her out of the home. Rae\u2019s suspicions proved horrifyingly true: at a later date, when her biological mother was able to take her to London for a while, 11-year-old Whitbread was raped by a man who was staying at the flat.</p> <p>Back at the children\u2019s home and traumatised, Whitbread refused to go to school. \u201cI just became withdrawn. Having not spoken to anyone about it, I felt ashamed, dirty.\u201d Eventually, she told Rae what had happened. Whitbread says it was reported, but nothing was done (she was referred to a child psychologist for a couple of weeks). \u201cUnbelievable what went on back then. You were never taken seriously. We had a social worker and I would talk to him about it. Nothing ever happened. Nobody took notice of the kids.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sport gave me a sense of freedom, forgetting all the problems that were going on in the home</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Is she angry at the system that failed her so spectacularly? \u201cWell, it does make me \u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cEven today, some of the crazy policies \u2013 ousting kids [from care] at 16 is appalling. My son still lives at home; he\u2019s 25. At 16, these are vulnerable kids.\u201d At present, councils are allowed to put 16- and 17-year-old children in unregulated accommodation, although <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-bans-unregulated-accommodation-for-young-people-in-care\" title=\"\">a ban on the practice</a> will come into force in October. \u201cFor a lot of young kids, history starts repeating itself: they start getting in trouble, or offending, and it costs the state a whole lot more. These young kids need that support, because once they get out there they\u2019re easily preyed upon. They\u2019re still kids.\u201d</p> <p>She worries about the cost of living crisis, inequality and poverty: \u201cThe kids are the ones that are getting the damage done.\u201d</p> <p>Sport saved her, she says. \u201cIt gave me a sense of freedom, forgetting all the problems that were going on in the home and the life we were living. It gave me a sense of achievement, that here was something I was good at. I got validation from my PE teachers and my school friends and started to realise life was a bit more positive. I realised that this could be my way out.\u201d</p> <p>Whitbread became the school netball captain and started going to a local athletics club. The javelin coach, Margaret Whitbread, recognised her talent. When she found out Whitbread lived in a children\u2019s home, she gave her some secondhand boots and a javelin. When Whitbread was grounded for a month, she managed to get a note to Margaret, fearing the coach would think she had left. She wrote that she hoped Margaret would take her back and that she intended to become the best javelin thrower in the world. \u201cIt was the start of a dream,\u201d says Whitbread.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1ce9cea740e69338cabf403dfe3f36a0c4d714a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ce9cea740e69338cabf403dfe3f36a0c4d714a3/0_0_5244_3592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fatima Whitbread the Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Canada, in 1978\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Canada, in 1978.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Duffy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Margaret and her husband eventually fostered Whitbread, who changed her surname, Vedad, by deed poll. At 14, she finally had a family, which included the Whitbreads\u2019 two young sons. \u201cThat was amazing, the best thing that happened, to be a part of a family, which I\u2019d always wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t straightforward, because all families have their problems. Both as mum and daughter and athlete and coach, we worked it out somehow \u2013 and we conquered the world.\u201d</p> <p>Whitbread began training hard. \u201cI started taking more responsibility for myself,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have a whole lot of people that help you, but I\u2019ve got to get myself out at 5am, down the gym, three times a day training, seven days a week.\u201d She trained in a wooden shed at the bottom of the garden of a family friend. She smiles when she talks about how different facilities are now: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way. I loved every minute of it.\u201d</p> <p>Just two years later, in 1979, Whitbread was crowned European junior champion \u2013 becoming the first British woman to hold the title. At less than 1.65 metres (5ft 5in) tall, she wasn\u2019t built like a champion javelin thrower, but what she lacked in reach she made up for in determination: \u201cI had little room to manoeuvre where making mistakes was concerned, so I had to work exceptionally hard at analysing everybody\u2019s techniques and working out the best for me.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After retiring, the sense of loss, of identity and purpose, is very hard</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What made her a good \u2013 at one stage, the best \u2013 thrower? \u201cI think the inner strength that I created as a child. If you asked me: \u2018Would I change anything about my life?\u2019 I\u2019d say no, because that created who I am. I had steely inner strength and a sense of determination to succeed because of my childhood. I possibly wouldn\u2019t have had that otherwise.\u201d She pauses. \u201cThere are some things you would have wanted to change.\u201d</p> <p>Whitbread had an incredible career \u2013 she was European and world champion and won bronze and silver at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics respectively. In 1986, she broke the world record with a throw of 77.44m. \u201cThat was a monumental experience,\u201d says Whitbread. As she let go of the javelin, she knew it was a good throw. \u201cThe hours and hours and hours of work that you put in, in order to get everything to click at the right time on the right day \u2026\u201d</p> <p>People told her it was the wrong day \u2013 it was the qualifying round for the European championships, so she had to go back and do it again. \u201cI just thought: I\u2019ll give it 100% and see what happens. I never allowed all that talk to get into there,\u201d she says, pointing at her head. \u201cI kept my mindset focused.\u201d She didn\u2019t manage to break her own record, but threw well enough to take gold.</p> <p>Much was made of her rivalry with the other British champion javelin thrower, Tessa Sanderson, who won the gold medal at the 1984 Olympics (Whitbread took bronze). \u201cBetween us, we achieved everything you could in an event. That\u2019s quite an astounding achievement for a country that wasn\u2019t known for its power events, so Tessa and I really flew that flag.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8f3af0c2d2f986ebff22f6ff578307220a5e3cb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f3af0c2d2f986ebff22f6ff578307220a5e3cb6/0_0_3432_4345/790.jpg\" alt=\"Fatima Whitbread with her bronze medal at the 1984 Olympics\" width=\"790\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her bronze medal at the 1984 Olympics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Duffy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rivalry was real \u2013 although Whitbread says her main rival was East Germany\u2019s Petra Felke \u2013 but the media amped it up. Sanderson, who is a few years older, had been Whitbread\u2019s idol. Whitbread says she would have liked to have been friends. \u201cI thought there\u2019s nothing better than to be able to have a good friendship in an event where you can pull together. But everyone\u2019s different, aren\u2019t they? The media, what they instigated, it didn\u2019t lend itself very well [to friendship].\u201d</p> <p>Whitbread was aware of the comments in the media about her muscular physique. Did she care about that? \u201cIt\u2019s tools for the job,\u201d she says of her body. Had she been taller, maybe her muscles wouldn\u2019t have been so noticeable, but she was \u201cstubby\u201d, she says, laughing. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t care, because I loved what I did and that\u2019s what it took for me to succeed. I didn\u2019t take notice; I was just proud of my work ethos. But sometimes they could be unkind.\u201d</p> <p>As a child in the 80s, I say, I loved watching Whitbread and Sanderson \u2013 so strong and powerful, like warrior goddesses. She smiles: \u201cI think there were a lot of people who felt like that.\u201d</p> <p>Her success brought fame \u2013 and intrusion. The tabloids found her biological mother. The trauma resurfaced. \u201cIt forced me to have to tell my story. That was really the start of the demise in my athletic career, because it brought me to a physical and mental breakdown.\u201d While training for the 1988 Olympics, she was also writing a book about her childhood, to try to get control of her story. \u201cIt was awful. I shouldn\u2019t have gone to that Olympics, but I managed to pull on all my reserves and I came away with the silver medal.\u201d</p> <p>In the run-up, when she should have been training hard, she lost \u201call sense of time. My procrastination was terrible. When I was throwing, it was all over the place \u2013 30 metres, 40 metres, 70 metres.\u201d</p> <p>A shoulder injury, made worse by Whitbread\u2019s inability to train properly, ended her career officially in 1992. \u201cIt was eight years short, really,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a big loss. For three or four years after that, when I went to championships, I would be watching with sadness, because I probably would still have been out there, winning.\u201d</p> <p>She had wanted more gold medals, including an Olympic one, and was aiming to throw more than 80m: \u201cI think I could have done.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t about the medals, she says. \u201cThe sense of loss, of identity and purpose, and then having to reinvent yourself in something that fills that void and the passion you had, is very hard.\u201d She went into sports marketing and did coaching and development.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"beae0badda6c05282cbc487a3466bae9ab1e95dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/beae0badda6c05282cbc487a3466bae9ab1e95dd/0_0_3746_2483/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fatima Whitbread with Andy Norman in 1990\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Andy Norman in 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Gichigi/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1997, she married Andy Norman, the controversial athletics promoter, with whom she had a son, Ryan, a year later. (Norman had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/25/athletics.sport1\" title=\"\">implicated by the coroner</a> in the 1994 suicide of Cliff Temple, a Sunday Times journalist who had been investigating Norman\u2019s conduct as promotions officer of the British Athletics Federation.) After her traumatic childhood, she was determined that her son\u2019s would be different. \u201cI felt I would be a good mum,\u201d she says. \u201cI believed in myself. It was important for me to be able to prove that I could be a good mum and break the mould of what I\u2019d been through.\u201d</p> <p>She and Norman had experienced years of infertility, followed by a miscarriage, before their son was born via a third round of IVF. Norman left her for another athlete when Ryan was small, although he and Whitbread managed to remain close. Then, in 2007, he died suddenly, leaving Whitbread to raise Ryan alone. On top of that, it emerged that Norman had taken out loans, partly in Whitbread\u2019s name, which put her tens of thousands of pounds in debt. She had to sell the family home. The fees from reality TV kept her afloat and helped her rebuild her profile.</p> <p>She seems content, although a long friendship ended recently, which has saddened her: \u201cIt\u2019s not until something goes wrong in your life that everything else starts to come back and chase you.\u201d This is why she will stick at the therapy \u2013 she has found some kind of acceptance.

She is surely one good show away from \u201cbeloved\u201d status, which might prove to be the I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here! spin-off in which she is soon to star, alongside a select group of other former participants in the ITV show. She was on I\u2019m a Celeb in 2011, when her nasal cavity became home to a cockroach during one of the challenges \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s definitely something wriggling about in there!\u201d \u2013 and it took an hour for the camp doctor to flush it out. But I liked her best in last year\u2019s Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins, the Channel 4 series in which celebs do Special Forces training; Whitbread cracked three ribs jumping out of a helicopter, but kept it a secret because she didn\u2019t want to leave the show. She was charming, warm, capable and \u2013 having filmed it at 60 \u2013 ripped. This morning, she has been out exercising for two hours. She does an hour of cardio or weights every day. Even her jack russell terrier, Bertie, is ageing well; the vet remarked recently on his good health. \u201cThey said he\u2019s got a heartbeat like an athlete,\u201d says Whitbread, smiling. That is what you get when you are owned by an Olympic medallist and former world champion who once broke the women\u2019s javelin world record. Bertie sits between us on a large sofa in Whitbread\u2019s spotless, clutter-free home in Essex. The only hint at the greatness of her sporting career is a bronze cast of her hand, strong fingers wrapped around a javelin\u2019s grip, given to her by Madame Tussauds. Whitbread, 62, has led an extraordinary life. This decade has been defined so far by physical and psychological challenges. Last year, as well as the SAS show, she climbed Mont Blanc. About a year ago, for the first time, she started having therapy (even when she had a breakdown in her 20s, she powered through without professional help). \u201cI\u2019ve realised I\u2019ve done bloody marvellous without it, but sometimes things trigger and all those childhood years can come back to haunt you,\u201d she says. As a baby, Whitbread was abandoned in a flat in London and essentially left to die. After hearing her cries, neighbours called the police. Whitbread recovered in hospital from malnutrition, dehydration and her terrible physical condition, then spent her childhood in children\u2019s homes. \u201cI felt this deep sense of loss within me,\u201d she says. When she was five, she was introduced to her biological mother \u2013 having had no idea of her history \u2013 and moved to a children\u2019s home in Essex, where she had two half-siblings. \u201cThat was the first time I started questioning what was going on in my life and what was to become of me.\u201d It was a life of deprivation, physical and emotional. There wasn\u2019t enough food and they had few clothes. The children played in a cold garage with a concrete floor. Love and affection were scant. She was abandoned again and again. Occasionally, her biological mother would arrive to take her half-siblings home for a visit, but not Whitbread. Once, the woman she calls \u201cthe biological mother\u201d, never \u201cmy biological mother\u201d \u2013 a Turkish Cypriot woman who spoke almost no English \u2013 did take her, but changed her mind and sent her back to the home. Whitbread\u2019s biological father, a Greek Cypriot, also surfaced. She spent a week with him, with the promise that he would be back to collect her again the weekend after, but he didn\u2019t appear. \u201cI sat on the front wall for a whole weekend,\u201d she says. \u201cThe second weekend, I did the same thing. I think that cracked me, emotionally. I put these walls up around myself to secure me.\u201d The only person who showed Whitbread any love was a woman who worked in the home, known as Auntie Rae. It was Rae who stopped Whitbread\u2019s biological mother, who arrived one day with three men, from taking her out of the home. Rae\u2019s suspicions proved horrifyingly true: at a later date, when her biological mother was able to take her to London for a while, 11-year-old Whitbread was raped by a man who was staying at the flat. Back at the children\u2019s home and traumatised, Whitbread refused to go to school. \u201cI just became withdrawn. Having not spoken to anyone about it, I felt ashamed, dirty.\u201d Eventually, she told Rae what had happened. Whitbread says it was reported, but nothing was done (she was referred to a child psychologist for a couple of weeks). \u201cUnbelievable what went on back then. You were never taken seriously. We had a social worker and I would talk to him about it. Nothing ever happened. Nobody took notice of the kids.\u201d Is she angry at the system that failed her so spectacularly? \u201cWell, it does make me \u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cEven today, some of the crazy policies \u2013 ousting kids [from care] at 16 is appalling. My son still lives at home; he\u2019s 25. At 16, these are vulnerable kids.\u201d At present, councils are allowed to put 16- and 17-year-old children in unregulated accommodation, although a ban on the practice will come into force in October. \u201cFor a lot of young kids, history starts repeating itself: they start getting in trouble, or offending, and it costs the state a whole lot more. These young kids need that support, because once they get out there they\u2019re easily preyed upon. They\u2019re still kids.\u201d She worries about the cost of living crisis, inequality and poverty: \u201cThe kids are the ones that are getting the damage done.\u201d Sport saved her, she says. \u201cIt gave me a sense of freedom, forgetting all the problems that were going on in the home and the life we were living. It gave me a sense of achievement, that here was something I was good at. I got validation from my PE teachers and my school friends and started to realise life was a bit more positive. I realised that this could be my way out.\u201d Whitbread became the school netball captain and started going to a local athletics club. The javelin coach, Margaret Whitbread, recognised her talent. When she found out Whitbread lived in a children\u2019s home, she gave her some secondhand boots and a javelin. When Whitbread was grounded for a month, she managed to get a note to Margaret, fearing the coach would think she had left. She wrote that she hoped Margaret would take her back and that she intended to become the best javelin thrower in the world. \u201cIt was the start of a dream,\u201d says Whitbread. Margaret and her husband eventually fostered Whitbread, who changed her surname, Vedad, by deed poll. At 14, she finally had a family, which included the Whitbreads\u2019 two young sons. \u201cThat was amazing, the best thing that happened, to be a part of a family, which I\u2019d always wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t straightforward, because all families have their problems. Both as mum and daughter and athlete and coach, we worked it out somehow \u2013 and we conquered the world.\u201d Whitbread began training hard. \u201cI started taking more responsibility for myself,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have a whole lot of people that help you, but I\u2019ve got to get myself out at 5am, down the gym, three times a day training, seven days a week.\u201d She trained in a wooden shed at the bottom of the garden of a family friend. She smiles when she talks about how different facilities are now: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way. I loved every minute of it.\u201d Just two years later, in 1979, Whitbread was crowned European junior champion \u2013 becoming the first British woman to hold the title. At less than 1.65 metres (5ft 5in) tall, she wasn\u2019t built like a champion javelin thrower, but what she lacked in reach she made up for in determination: \u201cI had little room to manoeuvre where making mistakes was concerned, so I had to work exceptionally hard at analysing everybody\u2019s techniques and working out the best for me.\u201d What made her a good \u2013 at one stage, the best \u2013 thrower? \u201cI think the inner strength that I created as a child. If you asked me: \u2018Would I change anything about my life?\u2019 I\u2019d say no, because that created who I am. I had steely inner strength and a sense of determination to succeed because of my childhood. I possibly wouldn\u2019t have had that otherwise.\u201d She pauses. \u201cThere are some things you would have wanted to change.\u201d Whitbread had an incredible career \u2013 she was European and world champion and won bronze and silver at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics respectively. In 1986, she broke the world record with a throw of 77.44m. \u201cThat was a monumental experience,\u201d says Whitbread. As she let go of the javelin, she knew it was a good throw. \u201cThe hours and hours and hours of work that you put in, in order to get everything to click at the right time on the right day \u2026\u201d People told her it was the wrong day \u2013 it was the qualifying round for the European championships, so she had to go back and do it again. \u201cI just thought: I\u2019ll give it 100% and see what happens. I never allowed all that talk to get into there,\u201d she says, pointing at her head. \u201cI kept my mindset focused.\u201d She didn\u2019t manage to break her own record, but threw well enough to take gold. Much was made of her rivalry with the other British champion javelin thrower, Tessa Sanderson, who won the gold medal at the 1984 Olympics (Whitbread took bronze). \u201cBetween us, we achieved everything you could in an event. That\u2019s quite an astounding achievement for a country that wasn\u2019t known for its power events, so Tessa and I really flew that flag.\u201d The rivalry was real \u2013 although Whitbread says her main rival was East Germany\u2019s Petra Felke \u2013 but the media amped it up. Sanderson, who is a few years older, had been Whitbread\u2019s idol. Whitbread says she would have liked to have been friends. \u201cI thought there\u2019s nothing better than to be able to have a good friendship in an event where you can pull together. But everyone\u2019s different, aren\u2019t they? The media, what they instigated, it didn\u2019t lend itself very well [to friendship].\u201d Whitbread was aware of the comments in the media about her muscular physique. Did she care about that? \u201cIt\u2019s tools for the job,\u201d she says of her body. Had she been taller, maybe her muscles wouldn\u2019t have been so noticeable, but she was \u201cstubby\u201d, she says, laughing. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t care, because I loved what I did and that\u2019s what it took for me to succeed. I didn\u2019t take notice; I was just proud of my work ethos. But sometimes they could be unkind.\u201d As a child in the 80s, I say, I loved watching Whitbread and Sanderson \u2013 so strong and powerful, like warrior goddesses. She smiles: \u201cI think there were a lot of people who felt like that.\u201d Her success brought fame \u2013 and intrusion. The tabloids found her biological mother. The trauma resurfaced. \u201cIt forced me to have to tell my story. That was really the start of the demise in my athletic career, because it brought me to a physical and mental breakdown.\u201d While training for the 1988 Olympics, she was also writing a book about her childhood, to try to get control of her story. \u201cIt was awful. I shouldn\u2019t have gone to that Olympics, but I managed to pull on all my reserves and I came away with the silver medal.\u201d In the run-up, when she should have been training hard, she lost \u201call sense of time. My procrastination was terrible. When I was throwing, it was all over the place \u2013 30 metres, 40 metres, 70 metres.\u201d A shoulder injury, made worse by Whitbread\u2019s inability to train properly, ended her career officially in 1992. \u201cIt was eight years short, really,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a big loss. For three or four years after that, when I went to championships, I would be watching with sadness, because I probably would still have been out there, winning.\u201d She had wanted more gold medals, including an Olympic one, and was aiming to throw more than 80m: \u201cI think I could have done.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t about the medals, she says. \u201cThe sense of loss, of identity and purpose, and then having to reinvent yourself in something that fills that void and the passion you had, is very hard.\u201d She went into sports marketing and did coaching and development. In 1997, she married Andy Norman, the controversial athletics promoter, with whom she had a son, Ryan, a year later. (Norman had been implicated by the coroner in the 1994 suicide of Cliff Temple, a Sunday Times journalist who had been investigating Norman\u2019s conduct as promotions officer of the British Athletics Federation.) After her traumatic childhood, she was determined that her son\u2019s would be different. \u201cI felt I would be a good mum,\u201d she says. \u201cI believed in myself.

This decade has been defined so far by physical and psychological challenges. Last year, as well as the SAS show, she climbed Mont Blanc. About a year ago, for the first time, she started having therapy (even when she had a breakdown in her 20s, she powered through without professional help). \u201cI\u2019ve realised I\u2019ve done bloody marvellous without it, but sometimes things trigger and all those childhood years can come back to haunt you,\u201d she says.</p> <p>As a baby, Whitbread was abandoned in a flat in London and essentially left to die. After hearing her cries, neighbours called the police. Whitbread recovered in hospital from malnutrition, dehydration and her terrible physical condition, then spent her childhood in children\u2019s homes. \u201cI felt this deep sense of loss within me,\u201d she says. When she was five, she was introduced to her biological mother \u2013 having had no idea of her history \u2013 and moved to a children\u2019s home in Essex, where she had two half-siblings. \u201cThat was the first time I started questioning what was going on in my life and what was to become of me.\u201d</p> <p>It was a life of deprivation, physical and emotional. There wasn\u2019t enough food and they had few clothes. The children played in a cold garage with a concrete floor. Love and affection were scant. She was abandoned again and again. Occasionally, her biological mother would arrive to take her half-siblings home for a visit, but not Whitbread. Once, the woman she calls \u201cthe biological mother\u201d, never \u201cmy biological mother\u201d \u2013 a Turkish Cypriot woman who spoke almost no English \u2013 did take her, but changed her mind and sent her back to the home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"390a076b008f699e8a019067d827428272c5a82b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/390a076b008f699e8a019067d827428272c5a82b/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fatima Whitbread with Ferne McCann on Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins in 2022\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Whitbread with Ferne McCann on Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins in 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Dadds/Channel 4/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whitbread\u2019s biological father, a Greek Cypriot, also surfaced. She spent a week with him, with the promise that he would be back to collect her again the weekend after, but he didn\u2019t appear. \u201cI sat on the front wall for a whole weekend,\u201d she says. \u201cThe second weekend, I did the same thing. I think that cracked me, emotionally. I put these walls up around myself to secure me.\u201d</p> <p>The only person who showed Whitbread any love was a woman who worked in the home, known as Auntie Rae. It was Rae who stopped Whitbread\u2019s biological mother, who arrived one day with three men, from taking her out of the home. Rae\u2019s suspicions proved horrifyingly true: at a later date, when her biological mother was able to take her to London for a while, 11-year-old Whitbread was raped by a man who was staying at the flat.</p> <p>Back at the children\u2019s home and traumatised, Whitbread refused to go to school. \u201cI just became withdrawn. Having not spoken to anyone about it, I felt ashamed, dirty.\u201d Eventually, she told Rae what had happened. Whitbread says it was reported, but nothing was done (she was referred to a child psychologist for a couple of weeks). \u201cUnbelievable what went on back then. You were never taken seriously. We had a social worker and I would talk to him about it. Nothing ever happened. Nobody took notice of the kids.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sport gave me a sense of freedom, forgetting all the problems that were going on in the home</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Is she angry at the system that failed her so spectacularly? \u201cWell, it does make me \u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cEven today, some of the crazy policies \u2013 ousting kids [from care] at 16 is appalling. My son still lives at home; he\u2019s 25. At 16, these are vulnerable kids.\u201d At present, councils are allowed to put 16- and 17-year-old children in unregulated accommodation, although <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-bans-unregulated-accommodation-for-young-people-in-care\" title=\"\">a ban on the practice</a> will come into force in October. \u201cFor a lot of young kids, history starts repeating itself: they start getting in trouble, or offending, and it costs the state a whole lot more. These young kids need that support, because once they get out there they\u2019re easily preyed upon. They\u2019re still kids.\u201d</p> <p>She worries about the cost of living crisis, inequality and poverty: \u201cThe kids are the ones that are getting the damage done.\u201d</p> <p>Sport saved her, she says. \u201cIt gave me a sense of freedom, forgetting all the problems that were going on in the home and the life we were living. It gave me a sense of achievement, that here was something I was good at. I got validation from my PE teachers and my school friends and started to realise life was a bit more positive. I realised that this could be my way out.\u201d</p> <p>Whitbread became the school netball captain and started going to a local athletics club. The javelin coach, Margaret Whitbread, recognised her talent. When she found out Whitbread lived in a children\u2019s home, she gave her some secondhand boots and a javelin. When Whitbread was grounded for a month, she managed to get a note to Margaret, fearing the coach would think she had left. She wrote that she hoped Margaret would take her back and that she intended to become the best javelin thrower in the world. \u201cIt was the start of a dream,\u201d says Whitbread.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1ce9cea740e69338cabf403dfe3f36a0c4d714a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ce9cea740e69338cabf403dfe3f36a0c4d714a3/0_0_5244_3592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fatima Whitbread the Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Canada, in 1978\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Canada, in 1978.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Duffy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Margaret and her husband eventually fostered Whitbread, who changed her surname, Vedad, by deed poll. At 14, she finally had a family, which included the Whitbreads\u2019 two young sons. \u201cThat was amazing, the best thing that happened, to be a part of a family, which I\u2019d always wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t straightforward, because all families have their problems. Both as mum and daughter and athlete and coach, we worked it out somehow \u2013 and we conquered the world.\u201d</p> <p>Whitbread began training hard. \u201cI started taking more responsibility for myself,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have a whole lot of people that help you, but I\u2019ve got to get myself out at 5am, down the gym, three times a day training, seven days a week.\u201d She trained in a wooden shed at the bottom of the garden of a family friend. She smiles when she talks about how different facilities are now: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way. I loved every minute of it.\u201d</p> <p>Just two years later, in 1979, Whitbread was crowned European junior champion \u2013 becoming the first British woman to hold the title. At less than 1.65 metres (5ft 5in) tall, she wasn\u2019t built like a champion javelin thrower, but what she lacked in reach she made up for in determination: \u201cI had little room to manoeuvre where making mistakes was concerned, so I had to work exceptionally hard at analysing everybody\u2019s techniques and working out the best for me.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After retiring, the sense of loss, of identity and purpose, is very hard</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What made her a good \u2013 at one stage, the best \u2013 thrower? \u201cI think the inner strength that I created as a child. If you asked me: \u2018Would I change anything about my life?\u2019 I\u2019d say no, because that created who I am. I had steely inner strength and a sense of determination to succeed because of my childhood. I possibly wouldn\u2019t have had that otherwise.\u201d She pauses. \u201cThere are some things you would have wanted to change.\u201d</p> <p>Whitbread had an incredible career \u2013 she was European and world champion and won bronze and silver at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics respectively. In 1986, she broke the world record with a throw of 77.44m. \u201cThat was a monumental experience,\u201d says Whitbread. As she let go of the javelin, she knew it was a good throw. \u201cThe hours and hours and hours of work that you put in, in order to get everything to click at the right time on the right day \u2026\u201d</p> <p>People told her it was the wrong day \u2013 it was the qualifying round for the European championships, so she had to go back and do it again. \u201cI just thought: I\u2019ll give it 100% and see what happens. I never allowed all that talk to get into there,\u201d she says, pointing at her head. \u201cI kept my mindset focused.\u201d She didn\u2019t manage to break her own record, but threw well enough to take gold.</p> <p>Much was made of her rivalry with the other British champion javelin thrower, Tessa Sanderson, who won the gold medal at the 1984 Olympics (Whitbread took bronze). \u201cBetween us, we achieved everything you could in an event. That\u2019s quite an astounding achievement for a country that wasn\u2019t known for its power events, so Tessa and I really flew that flag.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8f3af0c2d2f986ebff22f6ff578307220a5e3cb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f3af0c2d2f986ebff22f6ff578307220a5e3cb6/0_0_3432_4345/790.jpg\" alt=\"Fatima Whitbread with her bronze medal at the 1984 Olympics\" width=\"790\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her bronze medal at the 1984 Olympics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Duffy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rivalry was real \u2013 although Whitbread says her main rival was East Germany\u2019s Petra Felke \u2013 but the media amped it up. Sanderson, who is a few years older, had been Whitbread\u2019s idol. Whitbread says she would have liked to have been friends. \u201cI thought there\u2019s nothing better than to be able to have a good friendship in an event where you can pull together. But everyone\u2019s different, aren\u2019t they? The media, what they instigated, it didn\u2019t lend itself very well [to friendship].\u201d</p> <p>Whitbread was aware of the comments in the media about her muscular physique. Did she care about that? \u201cIt\u2019s tools for the job,\u201d she says of her body. Had she been taller, maybe her muscles wouldn\u2019t have been so noticeable, but she was \u201cstubby\u201d, she says, laughing. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t care, because I loved what I did and that\u2019s what it took for me to succeed. I didn\u2019t take notice; I was just proud of my work ethos. But sometimes they could be unkind.\u201d</p> <p>As a child in the 80s, I say, I loved watching Whitbread and Sanderson \u2013 so strong and powerful, like warrior goddesses. She smiles: \u201cI think there were a lot of people who felt like that.\u201d</p> <p>Her success brought fame \u2013 and intrusion. The tabloids found her biological mother. The trauma resurfaced. \u201cIt forced me to have to tell my story. That was really the start of the demise in my athletic career, because it brought me to a physical and mental breakdown.\u201d While training for the 1988 Olympics, she was also writing a book about her childhood, to try to get control of her story. \u201cIt was awful. I shouldn\u2019t have gone to that Olympics, but I managed to pull on all my reserves and I came away with the silver medal.\u201d</p> <p>In the run-up, when she should have been training hard, she lost \u201call sense of time. My procrastination was terrible. When I was throwing, it was all over the place \u2013 30 metres, 40 metres, 70 metres.\u201d</p> <p>A shoulder injury, made worse by Whitbread\u2019s inability to train properly, ended her career officially in 1992. \u201cIt was eight years short, really,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a big loss. For three or four years after that, when I went to championships, I would be watching with sadness, because I probably would still have been out there, winning.\u201d</p> <p>She had wanted more gold medals, including an Olympic one, and was aiming to throw more than 80m: \u201cI think I could have done.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t about the medals, she says. \u201cThe sense of loss, of identity and purpose, and then having to reinvent yourself in something that fills that void and the passion you had, is very hard.\u201d She went into sports marketing and did coaching and development.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"beae0badda6c05282cbc487a3466bae9ab1e95dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/beae0badda6c05282cbc487a3466bae9ab1e95dd/0_0_3746_2483/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fatima Whitbread with Andy Norman in 1990\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Andy Norman in 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Gichigi/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1997, she married Andy Norman, the controversial athletics promoter, with whom she had a son, Ryan, a year later. (Norman had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/25/athletics.sport1\" title=\"\">implicated by the coroner</a> in the 1994 suicide of Cliff Temple, a Sunday Times journalist who had been investigating Norman\u2019s conduct as promotions officer of the British Athletics Federation.) After her traumatic childhood, she was determined that her son\u2019s would be different. \u201cI felt I would be a good mum,\u201d she says. \u201cI believed in myself. It was important for me to be able to prove that I could be a good mum and break the mould of what I\u2019d been through.\u201d</p> <p>She and Norman had experienced years of infertility, followed by a miscarriage, before their son was born via a third round of IVF. Norman left her for another athlete when Ryan was small, although he and Whitbread managed to remain close. Then, in 2007, he died suddenly, leaving Whitbread to raise Ryan alone. On top of that, it emerged that Norman had taken out loans, partly in Whitbread\u2019s name, which put her tens of thousands of pounds in debt. She had to sell the family home. The fees from reality TV kept her afloat and helped her rebuild her profile.</p> <p>She seems content, although a long friendship ended recently, which has saddened her: \u201cIt\u2019s not until something goes wrong in your life that everything else starts to come back and chase you.\u201d This is why she will stick at the therapy \u2013 she has found some kind of acceptance. The older she has got, she says, the more she has realised that \u201clife is about absorbing the good and the bad, learning from both and still moving forward\u201d. She made a choice, she says, not to feel angry or bitter. \u201cThat\u2019s only damaging to yourself. It blurs your vision, it doesn\u2019t allow you to progress. When I go back and talk to the five-year-old or the 11-year-old Fatima, I take her by the hand and say: don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got you now.\u201d</p>", "bodyTextSummary": "In the latest of the many lives of Fatima Whitbread, the former champion javelin thrower has become a formidable reality TV star \u2013 and it suits her.

When she found out Whitbread lived in a children\u2019s home, she gave her some secondhand boots and a javelin. When Whitbread was grounded for a month, she managed to get a note to Margaret, fearing the coach would think she had left. She wrote that she hoped Margaret would take her back and that she intended to become the best javelin thrower in the world. \u201cIt was the start of a dream,\u201d says Whitbread.\nMargaret and her husband eventually fostered Whitbread, who changed her surname, Vedad, by deed poll. At 14, she finally had a family, which included the Whitbreads\u2019 two young sons. \u201cThat was amazing, the best thing that happened, to be a part of a family, which I\u2019d always wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t straightforward, because all families have their problems. Both as mum and daughter and athlete and coach, we worked it out somehow \u2013 and we conquered the world.\u201d Whitbread began training hard. \u201cI started taking more responsibility for myself,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have a whole lot of people that help you, but I\u2019ve got to get myself out at 5am, down the gym, three times a day training, seven days a week.\u201d She trained in a wooden shed at the bottom of the garden of a family friend. She smiles when she talks about how different facilities are now: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way. I loved every minute of it.\u201d Just two years later, in 1979, Whitbread was crowned European junior champion \u2013 becoming the first British woman to hold the title. At less than 1.65 metres (5ft 5in) tall, she wasn\u2019t built like a champion javelin thrower, but what she lacked in reach she made up for in determination: \u201cI had little room to manoeuvre where making mistakes was concerned, so I had to work exceptionally hard at analysing everybody\u2019s techniques and working out the best for me.\u201d\nWhat made her a good \u2013 at one stage, the best \u2013 thrower? \u201cI think the inner strength that I created as a child. If you asked me: \u2018Would I change anything about my life?\u2019 I\u2019d say no, because that created who I am. I had steely inner strength and a sense of determination to succeed because of my childhood. I possibly wouldn\u2019t have had that otherwise.\u201d She pauses. \u201cThere are some things you would have wanted to change.\u201d Whitbread had an incredible career \u2013 she was European and world champion and won bronze and silver at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics respectively. In 1986, she broke the world record with a throw of 77.44m. \u201cThat was a monumental experience,\u201d says Whitbread. As she let go of the javelin, she knew it was a good throw. \u201cThe hours and hours and hours of work that you put in, in order to get everything to click at the right time on the right day \u2026\u201d People told her it was the wrong day \u2013 it was the qualifying round for the European championships, so she had to go back and do it again. \u201cI just thought: I\u2019ll give it 100% and see what happens. I never allowed all that talk to get into there,\u201d she says, pointing at her head. \u201cI kept my mindset focused.\u201d She didn\u2019t manage to break her own record, but threw well enough to take gold. Much was made of her rivalry with the other British champion javelin thrower, Tessa Sanderson, who won the gold medal at the 1984 Olympics (Whitbread took bronze). \u201cBetween us, we achieved everything you could in an event. That\u2019s quite an astounding achievement for a country that wasn\u2019t known for its power events, so Tessa and I really flew that flag.\u201d\nThe rivalry was real \u2013 although Whitbread says her main rival was East Germany\u2019s Petra Felke \u2013 but the media amped it up. Sanderson, who is a few years older, had been Whitbread\u2019s idol. Whitbread says she would have liked to have been friends. \u201cI thought there\u2019s nothing better than to be able to have a good friendship in an event where you can pull together. But everyone\u2019s different, aren\u2019t they? The media, what they instigated, it didn\u2019t lend itself very well [to friendship].\u201d Whitbread was aware of the comments in the media about her muscular physique. Did she care about that? \u201cIt\u2019s tools for the job,\u201d she says of her body. Had she been taller, maybe her muscles wouldn\u2019t have been so noticeable, but she was \u201cstubby\u201d, she says, laughing. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t care, because I loved what I did and that\u2019s what it took for me to succeed. I didn\u2019t take notice; I was just proud of my work ethos. But sometimes they could be unkind.\u201d As a child in the 80s, I say, I loved watching Whitbread and Sanderson \u2013 so strong and powerful, like warrior goddesses. She smiles: \u201cI think there were a lot of people who felt like that.\u201d Her success brought fame \u2013 and intrusion. The tabloids found her biological mother. The trauma resurfaced. \u201cIt forced me to have to tell my story. That was really the start of the demise in my athletic career, because it brought me to a physical and mental breakdown.\u201d While training for the 1988 Olympics, she was also writing a book about her childhood, to try to get control of her story. \u201cIt was awful. I shouldn\u2019t have gone to that Olympics, but I managed to pull on all my reserves and I came away with the silver medal.\u201d In the run-up, when she should have been training hard, she lost \u201call sense of time. My procrastination was terrible. When I was throwing, it was all over the place \u2013 30 metres, 40 metres, 70 metres.\u201d A shoulder injury, made worse by Whitbread\u2019s inability to train properly, ended her career officially in 1992. \u201cIt was eight years short, really,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a big loss. For three or four years after that, when I went to championships, I would be watching with sadness, because I probably would still have been out there, winning.\u201d She had wanted more gold medals, including an Olympic one, and was aiming to throw more than 80m: \u201cI think I could have done.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t about the medals, she says. \u201cThe sense of loss, of identity and purpose, and then having to reinvent yourself in something that fills that void and the passion you had, is very hard.\u201d She went into sports marketing and did coaching and development.\nIn 1997, she married Andy Norman, the controversial athletics promoter, with whom she had a son, Ryan, a year later. (Norman had been implicated by the coroner in the 1994 suicide of Cliff Temple, a Sunday Times journalist who had been investigating Norman\u2019s conduct as promotions officer of the British Athletics Federation.) After her traumatic childhood, she was determined that her son\u2019s would be different. \u201cI felt I would be a good mum,\u201d she says. \u201cI believed in myself. It was important for me to be able to prove that I could be a good mum and break the mould of what I\u2019d been through.\u201d She and Norman had experienced years of infertility, followed by a miscarriage, before their son was born via a third round of IVF. Norman left her for another athlete when Ryan was small, although he and Whitbread managed to remain close. Then, in 2007, he died suddenly, leaving Whitbread to raise Ryan alone. On top of that, it emerged that Norman had taken out loans, partly in Whitbread\u2019s name, which put her tens of thousands of pounds in debt. She had to sell the family home. The fees from reality TV kept her afloat and helped her rebuild her profile. She seems content, although a long friendship ended recently, which has saddened her: \u201cIt\u2019s not until something goes wrong in your life that everything else starts to come back and chase you.\u201d This is why she will stick at the therapy \u2013 she has found some kind of acceptance. The older she has got, she says, the more she has realised that \u201clife is about absorbing the good and the bad, learning from both and still moving forward\u201d. She made a choice, she says, not to feel angry or bitter. \u201cThat\u2019s only damaging to yourself. It blurs your vision, it doesn\u2019t allow you to progress. When I go back and talk to the five-year-old or the 11-year-old Fatima, I take her by the hand and say: don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got you now.\u201d", "attributes": {}, "published": true, "createdDate": "2023-04-17T05:00:33Z", "firstPublishedDate": "2023-04-17T05:00:33Z", "publishedDate": "2023-04-17T05:00:33Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-04-14T16:13:35Z", "contributors": [], "elements": [{"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>In the latest of the many lives of Fatima Whitbread, the former champion javelin thrower has become a formidable reality TV star \u2013 and it suits her.

In 1986, she broke the world record with a throw of 77.44m. \u201cThat was a monumental experience,\u201d says Whitbread. As she let go of the javelin, she knew it was a good throw. \u201cThe hours and hours and hours of work that you put in, in order to get everything to click at the right time on the right day \u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>People told her it was the wrong day \u2013 it was the qualifying round for the European championships, so she had to go back and do it again. \u201cI just thought: I\u2019ll give it 100% and see what happens. I never allowed all that talk to get into there,\u201d she says, pointing at her head. \u201cI kept my mindset focused.\u201d She didn\u2019t manage to break her own record, but threw well enough to take gold.</p> \n<p>Much was made of her rivalry with the other British champion javelin thrower, Tessa Sanderson, who won the gold medal at the 1984 Olympics (Whitbread took bronze). \u201cBetween us, we achieved everything you could in an event.

Norman left her for another athlete when Ryan was small, although he and Whitbread managed to remain close. Then, in 2007, he died suddenly, leaving Whitbread to raise Ryan alone. On top of that, it emerged that Norman had taken out loans, partly in Whitbread\u2019s name, which put her tens of thousands of pounds in debt. She had to sell the family home.

You must grin harder and always maintain that Britain is, in fact, a race-relations utopia, even as things regularly happen that prove that we are far from that.</p> <p>Let\u2019s take just last week. A pub in Essex had its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/13/essex-police-investigating-golliwog-pub-display-examine-landlord-lynching-post\">collection of golliwogs confiscated</a>, after which they were promptly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/11/essex-pub-landlady-benice-ryley-replaces-golliwog-doll-collection-that-was-seized-by-police\">replaced with a new collection</a> by the landlady, who refuses to accept that they are racist. Some of the new golliwogs she says were sent in by sympathetic supporters. In the same week, a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-councillor-white-men-black-slave-andrew-edwards-b2319335.html\">Tory councillor was suspended</a> after he was reportedly recorded saying \u201call white men should have a Black slave\u201d and that black people \u201care a lower class than us white people\u201d. Neither of these incidents suggest that Britain is a uniformly racist place, but clearly, I think it\u2019s safe to say, something is going on.</p> <p>And that something is that it is possible for a society to make large strides towards racial equality, and still be meaningfully prejudiced in ways that make life difficult and uncomfortable for a significant number of people of colour. This is not a complicated fact. Racism isn\u2019t a disease that is cured by a single shot of medicine, it\u2019s a combination of attitudes and social values around which there are varying levels of agreement. We have agreed, for example, that you can\u2019t say the N-word. But, it seems, not against the hanging of golliwogs in public places, as the pub landlord <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/13/essex-police-investigating-golliwog-pub-display-examine-landlord-lynching-post\">commented on a Facebook post</a>, the way \u201cthey used to hang them in Mississippi years ago\u201d. You might think we also agreed that we couldn\u2019t say white people should own black slaves, but it seems that even that is not a certainty.</p> <p>Constantly realising all the questions you thought were settled are in fact not, is my abiding experience of being a non-white Briton. Along with those realisations comes a queasy sense of foreboding, because I know that suggesting that all might not be well in Britain on the race front isn\u2019t going to be pretty. In choosing not to smile, there is a price to pay. You\u2019ll have to be subjected to the usual: that you are oversensitive, woke, and in fact, actually the one making it about race when it\u2019s just some dolls hanging like they used to hang black folk in Mississippi. Despite all recent fictions about Black Lives Matter (BLM) ushering in an age of deference to black people, one only has to look at how race incidents are discussed in our politics, and our media, to see that our group response to expressing discomfort about race isn\u2019t exactly \u201clet me kneel in solidarity this very moment\u201d.</p> <p>Any questions asked of the appropriateness of our symbols or historical legacies is not merely met with a lack of deference, but with punishment. Students who suggest modifying curriculums are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/25/decolonise-cambridge-university-row-attack-students-colour-lola-olufemi-curriculums\">mauled in the press</a>; others who campaign against systemic racism, such as BLMUK, are <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/02/07/exclusive-far-left-influence-black-lives-matter-extinctionrebellion/\">investigated</a> for something called \u201cprogressive extremism\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/22/culture-war-chilling-effect-equality-government-rightwing-press\">struggle to open bank accounts</a> to disburse funds raised to support precariously employed and housed people. People such as Ngozi Fulani, who had the misfortune of expecting enlightened views of the royal household, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/08/ngozi-fulani-sistah-space-charity-boss-at-centre-of-royal-race-row-steps-down-over-abuse\">savaged</a> by the press and, in turn, members of the public, for pointing out that it\u2019s not very nice to be aggressively asked where you are from.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/13/essex-police-investigating-golliwog-pub-display-examine-landlord-lynching-post\">Essex police examine golly doll pub landlord\u2019s \u2018racist\u2019 Facebook posts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a sort of law of racial gravity \u2013 for every claim of a racist action there is a wildly unequal and disproportionate reaction. Most of the time I don\u2019t particularly care about who asked whom where they were from, or if there\u2019s a pub that wants to display golliwogs. Sometimes I actively will myself not to care, because really, in the grand scheme of things these are relatively small incidents that do not make up the sum total of the experience of being a person of colour in the UK. But one is forced into a state of outrage by a government and media that then throw their weight behind the aggressors. If we can be convinced that there is a powerful onslaught against the good British people and their history and traditions by radical leftwing identity politics, then maybe there\u2019s a chance we can be distracted from the colossal failures of the last 13 years.</p> <p>The home secretary, Suella Braverman, apparently found time to let it be known that she had <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/suella-braverman-makes-views-very-plain-to-police-over-golliwog-doll-seizure-from-essex-pub-12854721\">rebuked</a> the police for getting involved in the golliwog matter. In truth, according to weekend reports, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/10/essex-police-deny-braverman-rebuked-them-over-pub-seizure-of-golliwog-dolls\">no real attempt</a> was made by Braverman to contact Essex police. But no matter, for that starts a process. A columnist in the Telegraph laments the demonisation of the innocent golliwog and <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/columnists/2023/04/11/police-arrest-golly-doll-essex-toys-suella-braverman/\">says your teddy bears could be next</a>. The matter then becomes not one of outliers and hold-outs, but rightwing state and media sanction of their positions. The result is an encouragement and entrenchment of racist views, that is a constant drag on a Britain that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/sep/22/majority-of-uk-public-agree-with-liberal-views-on-race-and-sexual-identity-annual-poll\">becoming increasingly enlightened</a> on race.</p> <p>Racism as individuals acting out is ultimately a diversion from racism as threat to life and liberty. In the same week that golliwogs dominated, it was revealed that black girls are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/06/black-girls-three-times-more-likely-to-undergo-invasive-strip-search-by-met-police\">three times more likely</a> to undergo an invasive strip-search by Met police than white girls, and that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/09/britain-not-close-to-being-a-racially-just-society-finds-two-year-research-project\">more than a third</a> of people from ethnic and religious minorities have experienced racially motivated physical or verbal abuse. But when the Home Office gets involved to protect the right to insult you, then you have to care about golliwogs too. Because now they are now a matter of national debate, of dinner party conversations and school playground taunting, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouGov/status/1646151432780009472\">actual YouGov polling</a> that asks if golliwogs are racist \u2013 a swirling national discourse in which the final arbiter of what is racist is never you.</p> <p>It\u2019s dizzying, trying to calibrate the appropriate response to these travesties, because, yes, of course things are getting better. But they are also getting worse, because the frontier for what constitutes racial equality is always shifting. The questions are new: not ones of civil rights, but of all the cultural adjustments that are required to make people of colour feel at home and equal, not erased from history, not subject to the glorification of imperial overlords, not having to drink a pint as a golliwog hangs over them or as a nation debates whether they should be forced to. It\u2019s an awful lot of contempt to carry around with you, while simultaneously disciplining and reminding yourself that it\u2019s not all this nation has to offer.

Racism isn\u2019t a disease that is cured by a single shot of medicine, it\u2019s a combination of attitudes and social values around which there are varying levels of agreement. We have agreed, for example, that you can\u2019t say the N-word. But, it seems, not against the hanging of golliwogs in public places, as the pub landlord commented on a Facebook post, the way \u201cthey used to hang them in Mississippi years ago\u201d. You might think we also agreed that we couldn\u2019t say white people should own black slaves, but it seems that even that is not a certainty. Constantly realising all the questions you thought were settled are in fact not, is my abiding experience of being a non-white Briton. Along with those realisations comes a queasy sense of foreboding, because I know that suggesting that all might not be well in Britain on the race front isn\u2019t going to be pretty. In choosing not to smile, there is a price to pay. You\u2019ll have to be subjected to the usual: that you are oversensitive, woke, and in fact, actually the one making it about race when it\u2019s just some dolls hanging like they used to hang black folk in Mississippi. Despite all recent fictions about Black Lives Matter (BLM) ushering in an age of deference to black people, one only has to look at how race incidents are discussed in our politics, and our media, to see that our group response to expressing discomfort about race isn\u2019t exactly \u201clet me kneel in solidarity this very moment\u201d. Any questions asked of the appropriateness of our symbols or historical legacies is not merely met with a lack of deference, but with punishment. Students who suggest modifying curriculums are mauled in the press; others who campaign against systemic racism, such as BLMUK, are investigated for something called \u201cprogressive extremism\u201d and struggle to open bank accounts to disburse funds raised to support precariously employed and housed people. People such as Ngozi Fulani, who had the misfortune of expecting enlightened views of the royal household, are savaged by the press and, in turn, members of the public, for pointing out that it\u2019s not very nice to be aggressively asked where you are from. It\u2019s a sort of law of racial gravity \u2013 for every claim of a racist action there is a wildly unequal and disproportionate reaction. Most of the time I don\u2019t particularly care about who asked whom where they were from, or if there\u2019s a pub that wants to display golliwogs. Sometimes I actively will myself not to care, because really, in the grand scheme of things these are relatively small incidents that do not make up the sum total of the experience of being a person of colour in the UK. But one is forced into a state of outrage by a government and media that then throw their weight behind the aggressors. If we can be convinced that there is a powerful onslaught against the good British people and their history and traditions by radical leftwing identity politics, then maybe there\u2019s a chance we can be distracted from the colossal failures of the last 13 years. The home secretary, Suella Braverman, apparently found time to let it be known that she had rebuked the police for getting involved in the golliwog matter. In truth, according to weekend reports, no real attempt was made by Braverman to contact Essex police. But no matter, for that starts a process. A columnist in the Telegraph laments the demonisation of the innocent golliwog and says your teddy bears could be next. The matter then becomes not one of outliers and hold-outs, but rightwing state and media sanction of their positions. The result is an encouragement and entrenchment of racist views, that is a constant drag on a Britain that is becoming increasingly enlightened on race. Racism as individuals acting out is ultimately a diversion from racism as threat to life and liberty. In the same week that golliwogs dominated, it was revealed that black girls are three times more likely to undergo an invasive strip-search by Met police than white girls, and that more than a third of people from ethnic and religious minorities have experienced racially motivated physical or verbal abuse. But when the Home Office gets involved to protect the right to insult you, then you have to care about golliwogs too. Because now they are now a matter of national debate, of dinner party conversations and school playground taunting, and actual YouGov polling that asks if golliwogs are racist \u2013 a swirling national discourse in which the final arbiter of what is racist is never you. It\u2019s dizzying, trying to calibrate the appropriate response to these travesties, because, yes, of course things are getting better. But they are also getting worse, because the frontier for what constitutes racial equality is always shifting. The questions are new: not ones of civil rights, but of all the cultural adjustments that are required to make people of colour feel at home and equal, not erased from history, not subject to the glorification of imperial overlords, not having to drink a pint as a golliwog hangs over them or as a nation debates whether they should be forced to. It\u2019s an awful lot of contempt to carry around with you, while simultaneously disciplining and reminding yourself that it\u2019s not all this nation has to offer. So forgive me, for not smiling.

Students who suggest modifying curriculums are mauled in the press; others who campaign against systemic racism, such as BLMUK, are investigated for something called \u201cprogressive extremism\u201d and struggle to open bank accounts to disburse funds raised to support precariously employed and housed people. People such as Ngozi Fulani, who had the misfortune of expecting enlightened views of the royal household, are savaged by the press and, in turn, members of the public, for pointing out that it\u2019s not very nice to be aggressively asked where you are from.\nIt\u2019s a sort of law of racial gravity \u2013 for every claim of a racist action there is a wildly unequal and disproportionate reaction. Most of the time I don\u2019t particularly care about who asked whom where they were from, or if there\u2019s a pub that wants to display golliwogs. Sometimes I actively will myself not to care, because really, in the grand scheme of things these are relatively small incidents that do not make up the sum total of the experience of being a person of colour in the UK. But one is forced into a state of outrage by a government and media that then throw their weight behind the aggressors. If we can be convinced that there is a powerful onslaught against the good British people and their history and traditions by radical leftwing identity politics, then maybe there\u2019s a chance we can be distracted from the colossal failures of the last 13 years. The home secretary, Suella Braverman, apparently found time to let it be known that she had rebuked the police for getting involved in the golliwog matter. In truth, according to weekend reports, no real attempt was made by Braverman to contact Essex police. But no matter, for that starts a process. A columnist in the Telegraph laments the demonisation of the innocent golliwog and says your teddy bears could be next. The matter then becomes not one of outliers and hold-outs, but rightwing state and media sanction of their positions. The result is an encouragement and entrenchment of racist views, that is a constant drag on a Britain that is becoming increasingly enlightened on race. Racism as individuals acting out is ultimately a diversion from racism as threat to life and liberty. In the same week that golliwogs dominated, it was revealed that black girls are three times more likely to undergo an invasive strip-search by Met police than white girls, and that more than a third of people from ethnic and religious minorities have experienced racially motivated physical or verbal abuse. But when the Home Office gets involved to protect the right to insult you, then you have to care about golliwogs too. Because now they are now a matter of national debate, of dinner party conversations and school playground taunting, and actual YouGov polling that asks if golliwogs are racist \u2013 a swirling national discourse in which the final arbiter of what is racist is never you. It\u2019s dizzying, trying to calibrate the appropriate response to these travesties, because, yes, of course things are getting better. But they are also getting worse, because the frontier for what constitutes racial equality is always shifting. The questions are new: not ones of civil rights, but of all the cultural adjustments that are required to make people of colour feel at home and equal, not erased from history, not subject to the glorification of imperial overlords, not having to drink a pint as a golliwog hangs over them or as a nation debates whether they should be forced to. It\u2019s an awful lot of contempt to carry around with you, while simultaneously disciplining and reminding yourself that it\u2019s not all this nation has to offer. So forgive me, for not smiling.

It\u2019s the smile, I think, its teeth frozen in a rictus grin behind the exaggerated redness of the lips. The golliwog seems to say that not only is it OK to \u201cminstrelise\u201d black people and display them as dolls, but that they should enjoy it.</p> \n<p>That smile is the price of entry into white British society, of acceptance and integration into workplaces, social groups and our wider politics and culture. The golliwog, despite it being a relic of the past, is in fact a symbol of the present. You are only allowed visibility as a black figure if you\u2019re grateful, permanently smiling in all circumstances. Your status, as someone who is part of Britain and therefore gets a say in how they experience it, is conditional on the fact that you must never suggest that the country is not quite so hospitable to you sometimes. Ideally, if you want social and professional mobility as a person of colour, if you want to be moved from the bottom shelf to a position of higher prominence, you must go further. You must grin harder and always maintain that Britain is, in fact, a race-relations utopia, even as things regularly happen that prove that we are far from that.</p> \n<p>Let\u2019s take just last week. A pub in Essex had its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/13/essex-police-investigating-golliwog-pub-display-examine-landlord-lynching-post\">collection of golliwogs confiscated</a>, after which they were promptly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/11/essex-pub-landlady-benice-ryley-replaces-golliwog-doll-collection-that-was-seized-by-police\">replaced with a new collection</a> by the landlady, who refuses to accept that they are racist. Some of the new golliwogs she says were sent in by sympathetic supporters. In the same week, a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-councillor-white-men-black-slave-andrew-edwards-b2319335.html\">Tory councillor was suspended</a> after he was reportedly recorded saying \u201call white men should have a Black slave\u201d and that black people \u201care a lower class than us white people\u201d. Neither of these incidents suggest that Britain is a uniformly racist place, but clearly, I think it\u2019s safe to say, something is going on.</p> \n<p>And that something is that it is possible for a society to make large strides towards racial equality, and still be meaningfully prejudiced in ways that make life difficult and uncomfortable for a significant number of people of colour. This is not a complicated fact. Racism isn\u2019t a disease that is cured by a single shot of medicine, it\u2019s a combination of attitudes and social values around which there are varying levels of agreement. We have agreed, for example, that you can\u2019t say the N-word. But, it seems, not against the hanging of golliwogs in public places, as the pub landlord <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/13/essex-police-investigating-golliwog-pub-display-examine-landlord-lynching-post\">commented on a Facebook post</a>, the way \u201cthey used to hang them in Mississippi years ago\u201d. You might think we also agreed that we couldn\u2019t say white people should own black slaves, but it seems that even that is not a certainty.</p> \n<p>Constantly realising all the questions you thought were settled are in fact not, is my abiding experience of being a non-white Briton. Along with those realisations comes a queasy sense of foreboding, because I know that suggesting that all might not be well in Britain on the race front isn\u2019t going to be pretty. In choosing not to smile, there is a price to pay. You\u2019ll have to be subjected to the usual: that you are oversensitive, woke, and in fact, actually the one making it about race when it\u2019s just some dolls hanging like they used to hang black folk in Mississippi.

Less than two hours after leaving with them, Ramirez was dead from a drug overdose after his new acquaintances abandoned him in the backseat of a cab. Investigators believe they used payment apps like Zelle to steal about $20,000 from his bank accounts before leaving him.</p> <p>A month later, John Umberger, a 33-year-old political consultant, was found dead in a Manhattan townhouse after meeting the same group of men at the Q, a multi-story queer nightclub around the corner from the Ritz. According to his mother, Linda Clary, Umberger had been with a group of friends until he decided to head to the Q alone to catch a late-night DJ show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef4e9e1bdf7ec69b09ce14fdd247407e2526177f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef4e9e1bdf7ec69b09ce14fdd247407e2526177f/19_93_1885_1885/1000.jpg\" alt=\"man poses, smiling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Umberger, who died after leaving the Q nightclub.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Linda Clary</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Umberger never got into the final cab that he ordered and was instead hustled into the backseat of another car by the suspects. The accused killers allegedly stole about $20,000 from Umberger\u2019s bank accounts, and filmed on their phones as he overdosed.</p> <p>\u201cIt speaks to their depravity,\u201d Clary tells the Guardian. \u201cAnd it is concerning how many other groups may be still doing it.\u201d</p> <p>These attacks are part of a wave of drug-assisted thefts that has left at least seven clubgoers dead in New York City, with at least 43 known druggings since September 2021, in at least <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/drugging-robbery-crime-manhattan/13049315/\">two separate patterns</a>.</p> <p>Police were initially dismissive of the incidents and blamed the victims. \u201cNYPD presented to me that John went to a club, got robbed, and was so depressed that he came home and did drugs,\u201d says Clary, who immediately doubted the story. \u201cIf that had happened to John, that would not have been his response on any level.\u201d</p> <p>Now police acknowledge those killings were not isolated incidents. This month they announced the arrests of four suspects who, according to prosecutor filings at the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, conspired to \u201capproach intoxicated individuals upon exiting a bar or nightclub, engage them in conversation, and offer and administer dangerous and illicit substances to them for the purpose of causing their incapacitation\u201d. A fifth person charged in the deaths remains at large.</p> <p>That indictment comes months after the <a href=\"https://pix11.com/news/local-news/manhattan/man-accused-of-robbing-drugging-manhattan-clubgoers-arrested-on-murder-charges-nypd/\">arrest</a> of an unconnected suspect in December 2022, charged with drug-assisted thefts that killed two clubgoers on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side.

And in January, a New York City law student, Jordan Taylor, went <a href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/wheres-jordan-taylor-nyc-law-student-missing-after-going-to-hells-kitchen-lgbtq-bar/4058071/\">missing</a> after visiting the Q, in a case that remains unsolved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e84cd6fbc92fc9976bba4d482a91fd4f403f6a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e84cd6fbc92fc9976bba4d482a91fd4f403f6a6/3_0_2993_1796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"portrait\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fashion designer Katie Gallagher.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Toth/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clary worries that there are even more drugging attacks that aren\u2019t getting attention. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that there are significantly more cases because I think out of embarrassment, shame or fear, victims have not come forward,\u201d she says.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Shady outsiders in gay spaces\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The NYPD chief of detectives, James Essig, has stressed that these drugging attacks aren\u2019t just aimed at queer people: \u201cThis is based solely on monetary gain,\u201d he said last year. But some members of the LGBTQ+ community say they feel particularly vulnerable, especially when hate crimes are on the rise.</p> <p>That includes Arthur Bramhandtam, a Hell\u2019s Kitchen resident and swimwear designer who frequents New York\u2019s queer venues. He can name at least four different friends who had been robbed of their phones or wallets, with three of the incidents in the last two months alone. \u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d he says. He doesn\u2019t believe the perpetrators belong to the community: \u201cIt\u2019s shady outsiders that come into these gay spaces.\u201d</p> <p>Miguel Tavares, a New Yorker who has joined Hell\u2019s Kitchen parties for more than a decade, thinks the thieves could be exploiting the things that make gay nightlife so appealing: \u201cThe truth is, I do let my guard down when I come out to these places, because you\u2019re yearning for connection. And I think for homosexuals especially, we want to commingle, want to let others into our friend groups.\u201d</p> <p>For queer people, the attacks pose a dilemma: how do you stay vigilant in intimate venues that are meant to allow you to drop your defenses?</p> <p>Marybec Griffin, a Rutgers University assistant professor who researches LGBTQ+ health, says the drugging attacks are just the \u201cnewest twist\u201d in the legacy of violence targeting queer people \u2013 \u201dsomething that has been happening since the beginning of time\u201d. But these attacks are particularly insidious \u201cbecause the perpetrators are preying on people in places where they\u2019re supposed to be safe\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f35f2a8ac4d25bec8d624561a16d17511af37a2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f35f2a8ac4d25bec8d624561a16d17511af37a2b/0_0_4000_2666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pride flags hang outside of storefronts in the Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighborhood in June 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pride flags hang outside of storefronts in the Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighborhood in June 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Carl Smith-Hudson, a Brooklyn resident who has been going out to Hell\u2019s Kitchen with his friends for years, says he often sees strangers approach queer people in the area with offers of drugs. \u201cThey target these areas, like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not gay, but listen, I have this for you, I have that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Bramhandtam says an atmosphere where drugs are commonplace allows perpetrators to blend in: \u201cMaybe someone\u2019s hitting on you, or you\u2019re hitting on them \u2013 it\u2019s not unusual for someone to just offer you a bump.\u201d He thinks thieves might also target people using more dissociative drugs, like GHB, ketamine and molly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s in a pretty good mood. They\u2019re not taking things that make you aggressive,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In this environment, it\u2019s easier for attackers to slip substances into people\u2019s drinks, or give someone a substance that\u2019s been combined with unknown drugs, says William Eggleston, an assistant professor and toxicologist at the State University of New York, Binghamton. \u201cThese drugs are often mixed, and most of the time, what you think you\u2019re buying is not necessarily what you\u2019re getting.\u201d</p> <p>Medical examiners found drugs in the victims\u2019 bodies that included fentanyl, cocaine, ethanol and p-fluorofentanyl. The latter is a synthetic opioid that\u2019s often mixed with fentanyl, and just about as deadly, according to Eggleston. It doesn\u2019t take much of either drug to slow someone\u2019s breathing or make them unresponsive, and \u201cit\u2019s important to note that the effects of drugs like fentanyl are increased with the presence of alcohol\u201d, he says.</p> <h2><strong>Skeptical cops</strong></h2> <p>Local government is aware of the problem. In response to the drugging attacks, New York City\u2019s office for the prevention of hate crimes has partnered with a non-profit called the <a href=\"https://avp.org/\">Anti-Violence Project</a> to monitor incidents in LGBTQ+ nightlife areas, promote safety practices and hand out fentanyl testing strips.</p> <p>Audacia Ray, AVP\u2019s director of community organizing and public advocacy, says venues can improve safety by training more eyes on their space. Even better if the staff are part of the queer community: \u201cOne of the bartenders we met during our canvassing was an elder gay man working for a private security company.

While Sharp\u2019s complaint didn\u2019t mention Umberger\u2019s death or drug-assisted thefts, Sharp accused his partners of turning the club into a toxic and racist work environment, and ordering security to turn a blind eye to drugs like GHB.</p> <p>The only person associated with the club who spoke to the Guardian was Nikki, a former security manager at the Q who declined to give her last name.

Less than two hours after leaving with them, Ramirez was dead from a drug overdose after his new acquaintances abandoned him in the backseat of a cab. Investigators believe they used payment apps like Zelle to steal about $20,000 from his bank accounts before leaving him. A month later, John Umberger, a 33-year-old political consultant, was found dead in a Manhattan townhouse after meeting the same group of men at the Q, a multi-story queer nightclub around the corner from the Ritz. According to his mother, Linda Clary, Umberger had been with a group of friends until he decided to head to the Q alone to catch a late-night DJ show. Umberger never got into the final cab that he ordered and was instead hustled into the backseat of another car by the suspects. The accused killers allegedly stole about $20,000 from Umberger\u2019s bank accounts, and filmed on their phones as he overdosed. \u201cIt speaks to their depravity,\u201d Clary tells the Guardian. \u201cAnd it is concerning how many other groups may be still doing it.\u201d These attacks are part of a wave of drug-assisted thefts that has left at least seven clubgoers dead in New York City, with at least 43 known druggings since September 2021, in at least two separate patterns. Police were initially dismissive of the incidents and blamed the victims. \u201cNYPD presented to me that John went to a club, got robbed, and was so depressed that he came home and did drugs,\u201d says Clary, who immediately doubted the story. \u201cIf that had happened to John, that would not have been his response on any level.\u201d Now police acknowledge those killings were not isolated incidents. This month they announced the arrests of four suspects who, according to prosecutor filings at the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, conspired to \u201capproach intoxicated individuals upon exiting a bar or nightclub, engage them in conversation, and offer and administer dangerous and illicit substances to them for the purpose of causing their incapacitation\u201d. A fifth person charged in the deaths remains at large. That indictment comes months after the arrest of an unconnected suspect in December 2022, charged with drug-assisted thefts that killed two clubgoers on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side. In March 2023, police also determined that the mysterious death of a rising New York fashion designer, Katie Gallagher, in July had been due to drug-assisted theft, though no suspects have been arrested. And in January, a New York City law student, Jordan Taylor, went missing after visiting the Q, in a case that remains unsolved. Clary worries that there are even more drugging attacks that aren\u2019t getting attention. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that there are significantly more cases because I think out of embarrassment, shame or fear, victims have not come forward,\u201d she says. \u2018Shady outsiders in gay spaces\u2019 The NYPD chief of detectives, James Essig, has stressed that these drugging attacks aren\u2019t just aimed at queer people: \u201cThis is based solely on monetary gain,\u201d he said last year. But some members of the LGBTQ+ community say they feel particularly vulnerable, especially when hate crimes are on the rise. That includes Arthur Bramhandtam, a Hell\u2019s Kitchen resident and swimwear designer who frequents New York\u2019s queer venues. He can name at least four different friends who had been robbed of their phones or wallets, with three of the incidents in the last two months alone. \u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d he says. He doesn\u2019t believe the perpetrators belong to the community: \u201cIt\u2019s shady outsiders that come into these gay spaces.\u201d Miguel Tavares, a New Yorker who has joined Hell\u2019s Kitchen parties for more than a decade, thinks the thieves could be exploiting the things that make gay nightlife so appealing: \u201cThe truth is, I do let my guard down when I come out to these places, because you\u2019re yearning for connection. And I think for homosexuals especially, we want to commingle, want to let others into our friend groups.\u201d For queer people, the attacks pose a dilemma: how do you stay vigilant in intimate venues that are meant to allow you to drop your defenses? Marybec Griffin, a Rutgers University assistant professor who researches LGBTQ+ health, says the drugging attacks are just the \u201cnewest twist\u201d in the legacy of violence targeting queer people \u2013 \u201dsomething that has been happening since the beginning of time\u201d. But these attacks are particularly insidious \u201cbecause the perpetrators are preying on people in places where they\u2019re supposed to be safe\u201d. Carl Smith-Hudson, a Brooklyn resident who has been going out to Hell\u2019s Kitchen with his friends for years, says he often sees strangers approach queer people in the area with offers of drugs. \u201cThey target these areas, like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not gay, but listen, I have this for you, I have that.\u2019\u201d Bramhandtam says an atmosphere where drugs are commonplace allows perpetrators to blend in: \u201cMaybe someone\u2019s hitting on you, or you\u2019re hitting on them \u2013 it\u2019s not unusual for someone to just offer you a bump.\u201d He thinks thieves might also target people using more dissociative drugs, like GHB, ketamine and molly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s in a pretty good mood. They\u2019re not taking things that make you aggressive,\u201d he says. In this environment, it\u2019s easier for attackers to slip substances into people\u2019s drinks, or give someone a substance that\u2019s been combined with unknown drugs, says William Eggleston, an assistant professor and toxicologist at the State University of New York, Binghamton. \u201cThese drugs are often mixed, and most of the time, what you think you\u2019re buying is not necessarily what you\u2019re getting.\u201d Medical examiners found drugs in the victims\u2019 bodies that included fentanyl, cocaine, ethanol and p-fluorofentanyl. The latter is a synthetic opioid that\u2019s often mixed with fentanyl, and just about as deadly, according to Eggleston. It doesn\u2019t take much of either drug to slow someone\u2019s breathing or make them unresponsive, and \u201cit\u2019s important to note that the effects of drugs like fentanyl are increased with the presence of alcohol\u201d, he says. Skeptical cops Local government is aware of the problem. In response to the drugging attacks, New York City\u2019s office for the prevention of hate crimes has partnered with a non-profit called the Anti-Violence Project to monitor incidents in LGBTQ+ nightlife areas, promote safety practices and hand out fentanyl testing strips. Audacia Ray, AVP\u2019s director of community organizing and public advocacy, says venues can improve safety by training more eyes on their space. Even better if the staff are part of the queer community: \u201cOne of the bartenders we met during our canvassing was an elder gay man working for a private security company. He knew what he was looking for. That was really helpful to have someone who had knowledge of queer culture to be in that space.\u201d Clubgoers who spoke to the Guardian said that some of the smaller, queer-owned venues removed from tourist areas felt safer than some of the larger bars and clubs in Manhattan. Many also agreed that the two venues that Martinez and Umberger visited before they died \u2013 the Ritz and the Q \u2013 felt like places where there was a higher risk of being harassed or robbed. At a press conference after last year\u2019s deaths, the Ritz\u2019s owner, Tom Greco, who is straight, said he would implement \u201cheightened bag checks\u201d and advised patrons to \u201cbe aware of who\u2019s with you and who\u2019s coming and going\u201d.

Greco didn\u2019t respond to messages requesting comment. The Q\u2019s owners also couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Last month, the club abruptly shut down following a lawsuit filed last June by co-founder Frank Sharp against his partners Bob Fluet and Allan Pikus.

Last month, the club <a href=\"https://w42st.com/post/q-club-shutters-amid-ongoing-litigation-and-umberger-homicide/\">abruptly shut down</a> following a <a href=\"https://instinctmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FILE_8646.pdf\">lawsuit</a> filed last June by co-founder Frank Sharp against his partners Bob Fluet and Allan Pikus. While Sharp\u2019s complaint didn\u2019t mention Umberger\u2019s death or drug-assisted thefts, Sharp accused his partners of turning the club into a toxic and racist work environment, and ordering security to turn a blind eye to drugs like GHB.</p> <p>The only person associated with the club who spoke to the Guardian was Nikki, a former security manager at the Q who declined to give her last name. She told the Guardian she never allowed illegal substances to be brought inside: \u201cSomething like that happens, you\u2019re getting the fuck out of my club.\u201d As for the deadly drug-assisted thefts: \u201cIt\u2019s fucked up. But it just happened. There was a lot going on, so it happened.\u201d</p> <p>Even when venues try to stop attacks, they aren\u2019t always taken seriously by police. The New York state senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, whose district includes Hell\u2019s Kitchen and Chelsea \u2013 another queer nightlife district \u2013 says he heard from a Chelsea gay bar owner who \u201cliterally pulled out a potential victim from a van\u201d after someone tried to kidnap one of his patrons. But law enforcement was skeptical when the owner reported it, the lawmaker says. \u201cI think there\u2019s immediately a sense of suspicion around men who frequent gay bars and nightclubs.\u201d</p> <p>Clary says she\u2019s also heard from other drug attack victims who tried reporting their attacks to police. But the victims, who were also gay, \u201cdid not get the care and concern from NYPD that everyone should get. They were like, \u2018You did this, that\u2019s on you.

But law enforcement was skeptical when the owner reported it, the lawmaker says. \u201cI think there\u2019s immediately a sense of suspicion around men who frequent gay bars and nightclubs.\u201d Clary says she\u2019s also heard from other drug attack victims who tried reporting their attacks to police. But the victims, who were also gay, \u201cdid not get the care and concern from NYPD that everyone should get. They were like, \u2018You did this, that\u2019s on you. Sorry, buddy.\u2019\u201d In an emailed statement, an NYPD spokesperson said it \u201cworks to establish patterns and motives in all robberies\u201d and \u201cthere are no robberies or kidnappings on file\u201d for the Chelsea bar last year. \u201cThe NYPD encourages all crime victims to come forward to police and report any incidents so that we can investigate and hold any perpetrators responsible,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u2018Stick with your friends\u2019 To make going out safer, it\u2019s crucial not to blame victims for what happened, says Griffin, of Rutgers University. \u201cShame is the enemy of open and honest communication.\u201d\nA better approach is a harm reduction model, which prioritizes giving people the tools and information to make informed choices about substances. \u201cThere is no reason why you shouldn\u2019t be able to test your substances to make sure you know what you\u2019re consuming,\u201d she says. Eggleston, the toxicologist, advises keeping your drink in your hand, and not accepting drinks from strangers. He recommends going to the emergency room if you think you\u2019ve been drugged \u2013 \u201cthey can do tests and keep a close eye on you.\u201d If you suspect someone you\u2019re with is overdosing, call 911 and give them naloxone, also known as Narcan, a medication that can stop overdoses. \u201cIf you\u2019re right, it\u2019ll help them start breathing again. If you\u2019re wrong, it\u2019s not going to hurt them.\u201d Bargoers should develop a safety plan with people they trust. \u201cHave a plan with a check-in person about when you plan to go home, and turn on location sharing on your phone,\u201d Ray, the community organizer, says. Ray also advises turning off face-unlocking on your phone. \u201cIt\u2019s something that folks have used when someone was incapacitated, to be able to get into their phone, turn off location sharing, and pull money out of their bank accounts.\u201d Hoylman-Sigal says he\u2019s contacted Zelle to ask for stronger fraud protection measures. \u201cI think the ease of defrauding customers who use their platform may have contributed to these horrific attacks,\u201d the state senator says. (A spokesperson for Zelle said it \u201ccontinues to have conversations\u201d with officials and financial institutions \u201cin how we can all partner to protect consumers\u201d.) But for now the best protection for many queer nightlifers remains each other. \u201cDon\u2019t take drugs from strangers that you don\u2019t know, and stick with your friends, right?\u201d says Bramhandtam, who also carries fentanyl test strips on nights out. \u201cThat\u2019s all you really got in these types of situations.\u201d Later this month, Bramhandtam plans to attend a Brooklyn queer party that was hit by a mass theft incident in February \u2013 so he expects he\u2019ll be looking out for suspicious outsiders. \u201cWe\u2019ve already created so many enclaves pretty far away from main parts of society,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they just keep finding us.\u201d", "attributes": {}, "published": true, "createdDate": "2023-04-17T05:00:32Z", "firstPublishedDate": "2023-04-17T05:00:32Z", "publishedDate": "2023-04-17T05:00:32Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-04-17T00:54:17Z", "contributors": [], "elements": [{"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>Last April, Julio Ramirez, a 25-year-old social worker, met a group of men at the Ritz Bar &amp; Lounge, a nautical-themed gay dance club in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, two blocks from Times Square.

The PSNI listed 62 investigations under way for alleged sexual misconduct.</p> <p>Among other larger forces, 33 officers were under investigation for alleged sexual misconduct at West Yorkshire, which has about 5,500 officers.

Reclaim These Streets, a movement that has campaigned to increase women\u2019s safety, said the figures were still a stark reminder of how policing was in need of reform. \u201cThese numbers demonstrate exactly why it is not appropriate for an all-white leadership team led by Metropolitan police commissioner Mark Rowley to only focus on sexual misconduct,\u201d it said. \u201cThere cannot and should not be a hierarchy of evils so that the squeakiest and loudest wheel gets attention but the others go unchecked. And this is not just a London problem.\u201d Andy George, the president of the National Black Police Association (NBPA), said the data was the type that was needed in order to understand the scale of the problem of racism in police ranks. \u201cSome of the lower figures are, in part, an indication of the lack of trust and confidence some people have about coming forward to make complaints. If you are really isolated in a workforce then it\u2019s particularly hard to come forward,\u201d he added. But the figures alone did not explain why there was such variation among forces, said George, who added that there was a pressing need for a more consistent approach to best practice and recording. \u201cWhen there are more than 40 different models of policing across England and Wales there is no consistency, which is a major challenge in itself,\u201d he said. While the figures showed that just three investigations were under way during the period concerned into allegations of racism in the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), George said his own experience of that force was that one-third of all minority ethnic officers had reported experiencing or witnessing racism. The PSNI listed 62 investigations under way for alleged sexual misconduct. Among other larger forces, 33 officers were under investigation for alleged sexual misconduct at West Yorkshire, which has about 5,500 officers. Sixteen were under investigation over alleged racism, eight of which were part of the same case. Police Scotland, which has about 16,644 officers, had 29 investigations under way over allegations of racism and 54 for alleged sexual misconduct. Bedfordshire police\u2019s chief constable, Trevor Rodenhurst, said the force was working relentlessly to identify and root out anyone who did not uphold standards. He added that its efforts would no doubt result in an increase in reports and investigations in the short term \u201cas those who betray our values are removed from the force\u201d. Suffolk constabulary said it was committed to tackling hate crime and racism and this included within the force, adding that employees and volunteers should feel confident that any allegations would be taken seriously and investigated thoroughly. A spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council said: \u201cThe public rightly expect the highest standards from police officers, and we are working hard to rid policing of abusers and corrupt individuals. \u201cWhen allegations are made and where criminal thresholds are met, we will take robust action against those involved, and we will continue to root out those whose actions do not meet that threshold but who betray our professional standards.\u201d", "charCount": "6196", "shouldHideReaderRevenue": "false", "showAffiliateLinks": "false", "bylineHtml": "<a href=\"profile/benquinn\">Ben Quinn</a> and <a href=\"profile/pamela-duncan\">Pamela Duncan</a>", "showTableOfContents": "false"}, "tags": [{"id": "uk/police", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webTitle": "Police", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/police", "references": []}, {"id": "uk/uk", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webTitle": "UK news", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk", "references": [{"id": "rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk", "type": "rich-link"}]}, {"id": "world/race", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webTitle": "Race", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/race", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/race", "references": []}, {"id": "uk/essex", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webTitle": "Essex", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/essex", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/essex", "references": []}, {"id": "uk-news/suffolk", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webTitle": "Suffolk", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/suffolk", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/suffolk", "references": []}, {"id": "campaign/email/morning-briefing", "type": "campaign", "webTitle": "First Edition (newsletter signup)", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/campaign/email/morning-briefing", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/campaign/email/morning-briefing", "references": [], "campaignInformationType": "email"}, {"id": "type/article", "type": "type", "webTitle": "Article", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/articles", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article", "references": []}, {"id": "tone/news", "type": "tone", "webTitle": "News", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news", "references": []}, {"id": "profile/benquinn", "type": "contributor", "webTitle": "Ben Quinn", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/benquinn", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/benquinn", "references": [], "bio": "<p>Ben Quinn is a news reporter for the Guardian.

It was 1960 and the pair had just met at a ceremony where Chagall was presented with the prestigious Erasmus prize. Philip would later recall the artist\u2019s \u201cjocular attitude\u201d as he showed him around his exhibition.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe gave me this Bible he has illustrated, just out of the blue. He was a very strange man,\u201d Philip reportedly said. It was also something of a strange gift. Inside the Bible, Chagall had daubed colourful illustrations in watercolours, chalk and ink. Those two illustrations could now be worth as much as \u00a360,000.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffaabfc8f6de80dd694e32abe14f603e57f10b2d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffaabfc8f6de80dd694e32abe14f603e57f10b2d/59_27_3973_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Image from Chagall\u2019s Bible given to Prince Philip.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"739\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Image from Chagall\u2019s Bible given to Prince Philip.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: His Majesty King Charles III 2023</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As contemporary artworks go, that is not a huge sum. However, the Chagall Bible is one of an extraordinary collection of almost 400 artworks, some worth much more, that have been exhibited by the Windsors in \u201cpersonal\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d collections.</p> \n<p>They are, in total, likely to be worth tens of millions of pounds, possibly more, and include pieces by Salvador Dal\u00ed, LS Lowry, Claude Monet and Lucian Freud.</p> \n<p>Many of the items, however, raise questions for the Windsors about whether all of these artworks should really belong to them. </p> \n<p>Royal art can broadly be separated into two categories. Most of it is part of the royal collection, more than a million items that are held in trust by the sovereign for the benefit of the nation. Described as one of the greatest art collections in the world, it is the nearest the UK has to a public custodian of royal-linked art.</p> \n<p>The second, much more elusive category is that which the royals treat as their own: the Windsors\u2019 private collection. There is no public register of these works and Buckingham Palace refuses to comment in any detail on what it regards as private wealth. However, items such as the Chagall Bible raise questions about what falls under that definition.</p> \n<p>Not in the royal collection, the artwork casually given to Philip on a state visit appears to have been absorbed into his own collection. At a special exhibition in Holyrood Palace in 1994, the Chagall piece was on display as part of the prince\u2019s \u201cpersonal collection\u201d.</p> \n<p>Buckingham Palace\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/07/what-are-the-rules-on-gifts-for-the-royal-family\">gift policy</a>, introduced the following year, distinguishes between \u201cofficial gifts\u201d, which are generally those received in the course of formal duties and functions, and \u201cpersonal gifts\u201d, from people whom members of the royal family know personally. The policy adds: \u201cIn all cases, and particularly on official overseas trips, organisations and individuals should be discouraged from offering extravagant gifts, ie gifts of high monetary value.\u201d</p> \n<p>Contacted by the Guardian, the palace declined to comment on the ownership status of the Chagall or more than a dozen other artworks that would appear to have been official gifts but have been exhibited as part of the Windsors\u2019 personal or private collections. \u201cIt is incorrect to suggest that the artworks you list were all official gifts,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe would not comment on the value of works of art.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>A Monet worth millions</strong></h2> \n<p>A watercolour artist himself, King Charles III is an aficionado of fine art.<strong> </strong>The four floors of his London residence, Clarence House, are filled with artwork, much of which is unequivocally the private property of the Windsors.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1458aaefe7828e2fbfc71c9835725ce445e362c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1458aaefe7828e2fbfc71c9835725ce445e362c/0_0_2795_1677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"TV presenter Claire Balding (L) talks to Camilla, the Queen Consort, during an event at Clarence House in April 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">TV presenter Claire Balding (L) talks to Camilla, the Queen Consort, during an event at Clarence House in April 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Charles can largely thank his grandmother for the art adorning the walls of Clarence House. An avid private collector, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother bought dozens of valuable artworks between the 1930s and 1950s, when prices were lower because of the war, and bargains could be found in the frequent country house sales of the time.</p> \n<p>Over the years, the queen mother filled Clarence House, then her London residence, with a collection worthy of any great gallery, although its presentation was more homely.</p> \n<p>In the corner of the Morning Room, behind a side table covered with family photographs and the shade of a table lamp, hangs what is probably the most valuable of all the art in the royals\u2019 private collection: Claude Monet\u2019s Study of Rocks; Creuse: Le Bloc. The painting was bought by the queen mother in 1945, at the Wildenstein gallery in Paris. The second world war had dampened art prices and she snapped it up for \u00a32,000, the equivalent of \u00a3110,000 today.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eec13dd10300d7b5746927244fdf325b8e000650\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eec13dd10300d7b5746927244fdf325b8e000650/0_0_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Camilla meeting the broadcaster Chris Evans at Clarence House in 2015 with Monet\u2019s Study of Rocks; Creuse: Le Bloc hanging on the wall behind her.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Camilla meeting the broadcaster Chris Evans at Clarence House in 2015 with Monet\u2019s Study of Rocks; Creuse: Le Bloc hanging on the wall behind her.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heathcliff O\u2019Malley/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Susan Orringe, of Prestige Valuations, told the Guardian the painting could fetch up to \u00a320m if it were sold today. However, she clarified that the estimated price was highly speculative and the paucity of Monets on the market, coupled with the fact that it had hung for decades in the queen mother\u2019s front room, could raise its value much higher.</p> \n<p>Clarence House, which used to be open to the public, has been closed since 2019. The Monet and other artworks can be seen in a <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/story/inside-clarence-house-clarence-house/dgXRGpeByJlLJg?hl=en-GB\">virtual tour</a> of the residence.</p> \n<p>The artworks also include Fylde Farm by LS Lowry, worth about \u00a3120,000, and a portrait of George Bernard Shaw by Augustus John, worth about \u00a370,000<strong>. </strong>Elsewhere in the house are multiple other works, including paintings by Paul Nash, Raffaellino del Garbo and Alfred Sisley. The Eve of St Agnes by John Everett Millais, which the queen mother bought at auction in 1942 for \u00a3630, could be worth about \u00a31.5m today.</p> \n<p>Charles moved into Clarence House in 2003, after the death of the queen mother the previous year. He has previously said that among his favourite works are a moody series of paintings of Windsor Castle by John Piper. They hang on the wall of his dining room. The queen mother paid \u00a310 each for them (equivalent to \u00a3646 in today\u2019s money). Today the set could be worth \u00a3150,000.</p> \n<p>It is assumed Charles has inherited almost all of the artwork previously owned by the queen mother, the queen and Prince Philip. As monarch, he is exempt from the inheritance tax that would be due on any high-value bequests to his siblings.</p> \n<p>However, it is impossible to know precisely who owns which pieces in the Windsors\u2019 private collection, and how much it may all be worth. </p> \n<p>The Guardian consulted experts on the value of 60 of the most significant works on a list of 392 identified as being privately owned by the Windsors. The total value of the 60 was estimated to be at least \u00a324m. But that valuation is based on only a fraction of a much larger collection.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a58417ce-9d40-4395-ab38-0bf2ace661d9\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian scoured press reports, exhibition guides and photographs and visited palaces to&nbsp;create a log of 392 artworks that appear to be owned by central members of the royal family. We focused on reports and exhibitions describing the personal or private collections of the Windsors.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>This is likely to be just a fraction of the total. The queen mother, for example, owned 1,200 prints, paintings and drawings, according to the art historian Dr Susan Owens. Prince Philip was estimated by the art expert Robin Simon to have had more than 1,500 works. It is not known how many the late queen owned, but it was presumably hundreds.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The log was then checked against the Royal Collection Trust, both via the online catalogue and through direct inquiries to the trust, which confirmed that none were officially part of the collection.</p>\n    <p>All 392 items are therefore believed to have been owned privately by the queen mother, Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth II or King Charles III.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Where possible, we logged details of how and when the artwork was acquired. We then asked the palace detailed questions about the ownership status of those we believed fell into the category of 'official gifts', according to the royal gift policy.</p>\n    <p>Experts estimated the potential sale value of 60 of the most significant pieces on the list based on comparable works by each artist, while working with limited information and without physical inspection.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The estimates did not take into account any \u2018royal premium\u2019 buyers might pay for artworks previously owned by the Windsors.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Susan Orringe, from Prestige Valuations, estimated works by Monet, Grant, Seago, Fantin-Latour, Topolski, Constable, Piper, Lowry, Chagall, Millais, Freud.</p>\n    <p>Robert James, from Coram James, estimated works by Augustus John, Nash, Del Garbo, Dali, Gainsborough.</p>\n    <p>Jane Raffan, from ArtiFacts, in Australia, estimated works by Namatjira, Pugh, Friend, Jack, Battarbee, Hill, Drysdale, Dobell, Landara, Inkamala, Pareroultja, Raberaba, Crooke, Charles Pro Hart, Swann, Dridan and Garner.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In 2020, the historian David McClure estimated that the queen mother\u2019s private collection, said to have comprised 1,200 prints, paintings and drawings, was worth \u00a330m. He concluded that Prince Philip\u2019s collection, said to include more than 1,500 items, was worth \u00a32m. In 2001, the art expert Robin Simon valued the queen\u2019s collection for the Mail on Sunday and concluded it was worth \u00a3150m (the equivalent of \u00a3261m today).</p> \n<p>That would suggest the Windsors\u2019 private collection could be worth more than \u00a3290m. However, the lack of any public register of these works means all of these estimates are speculative. It is impossible to say anything with certainty about the value of the private art collection, although there is no doubt it is worth many millions of pounds.</p> \n<h2><strong>Dal\u00ed and Freud</strong></h2> \n<p>The value of the private collection matters because while much of the Windsors\u2019 private art is unequivocally theirs, some of it might be better described as belonging to the nation. The royal policy on accepting gifts states that items presented on official duties, by people not considered close personal friends, \u201care not the private property of the member of the royal family who receives them\u201d.</p> \n<p>More than a third of the 392 pieces identified by the Guardian in private royal collections appear to have been gifts of one sort or another. Some were wedding presents, while others were official gifts on overseas trips, including from artists themselves. All were displayed in exhibitions of \u201cpersonal\u201d art collections. None are part of the public royal collection.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"415a0a6f9e9fcf05e6e4119899717453acd4ab11\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/415a0a6f9e9fcf05e6e4119899717453acd4ab11/0_0_4135_2481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charles presents the Prince of Wales medals for arts philanthropy at Clarence House in November 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charles presents the Prince of Wales medals for arts philanthropy at Clarence House in November 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anwar Hussein/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One such instance was a gift from the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dal\u00ed, whom Philip met in 1972 while staying near Avignon on a state visit to the south of France.

Philip bought works by Sidney Nolan and was given two paintings by William Dobell, which together are now worth in the region of \u00a3570,000.</p> \n<p>Jane Raffan, an Australian art expert and valuer, said that in the 1950s and 60s royal visitors behaved like \u201cupper-level tourists in that they were looking to acquire something, a souvenir from their trip, but they were not buying something from a tourist tat shop \u2026 in many ways it was a case of right time and place in regard to the Dobells, the Nolans and the Drysdales.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>\u2018I cannot resist it\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>Another blurred line around the Windsors\u2019 private collection relates to works produced by artists who accompany them on official tours. Philip befriended Edward Seago over the years and the Norfolk-based artist gave him and the queen mother many paintings. Sixty of those came from a trip Seago took with Philip on the Royal Yacht Britannia, when, after a state visit to Australia in 1956, they sailed on to the Antarctic.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe painted all these pictures and said: \u2018You can have them\u2019,\u201d Philip told the Scotsman newspaper. While the two men were friends at that point, the paintings were made and presented as part of an official royal trip. Yet none of them are in the royal collection. The trove of oils passed to the royals by Seago could now be worth as much as \u00a32.6m.</p> \n<p>Charles has also been known to take artists on royal tours overseas; a palace spokesperson stressed they were \u201cpersonally funded\u201d by him.

None are in the royal collection. They have, presumably, been incorporated into the king\u2019s private assets. Buckingham Palace declined to say where they were being kept, or why they were not in the royal collection. The locations of the works given to the royal family by Dal\u00ed, Chagall and Freud also remain a mystery. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Story%20tips%3F&amp;description=Do%20you%20have%20information%20about%20this%20story%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Ainvestigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Einvestigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20use%20Signal%20or%20WhatsApp%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566%20or%20(US)%20%2B1%20646%20886%208761.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22nothttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Do you have information about this story?

It was 1960 and the pair had just met at a ceremony where Chagall was presented with the prestigious Erasmus prize. Philip would later recall the artist\u2019s \u201cjocular attitude\u201d as he showed him around his exhibition. \u201cHe gave me this Bible he has illustrated, just out of the blue. He was a very strange man,\u201d Philip reportedly said. It was also something of a strange gift. Inside the Bible, Chagall had daubed colourful illustrations in watercolours, chalk and ink. Those two illustrations could now be worth as much as \u00a360,000. As contemporary artworks go, that is not a huge sum. However, the Chagall Bible is one of an extraordinary collection of almost 400 artworks, some worth much more, that have been exhibited by the Windsors in \u201cpersonal\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d collections. They are, in total, likely to be worth tens of millions of pounds, possibly more, and include pieces by Salvador Dal\u00ed, LS Lowry, Claude Monet and Lucian Freud. Many of the items, however, raise questions for the Windsors about whether all of these artworks should really belong to them. Royal art can broadly be separated into two categories. Most of it is part of the royal collection, more than a million items that are held in trust by the sovereign for the benefit of the nation. Described as one of the greatest art collections in the world, it is the nearest the UK has to a public custodian of royal-linked art. The second, much more elusive category is that which the royals treat as their own: the Windsors\u2019 private collection. There is no public register of these works and Buckingham Palace refuses to comment in any detail on what it regards as private wealth. However, items such as the Chagall Bible raise questions about what falls under that definition. Not in the royal collection, the artwork casually given to Philip on a state visit appears to have been absorbed into his own collection. At a special exhibition in Holyrood Palace in 1994, the Chagall piece was on display as part of the prince\u2019s \u201cpersonal collection\u201d. Buckingham Palace\u2019s gift policy, introduced the following year, distinguishes between \u201cofficial gifts\u201d, which are generally those received in the course of formal duties and functions, and \u201cpersonal gifts\u201d, from people whom members of the royal family know personally. The policy adds: \u201cIn all cases, and particularly on official overseas trips, organisations and individuals should be discouraged from offering extravagant gifts, ie gifts of high monetary value.\u201d Contacted by the Guardian, the palace declined to comment on the ownership status of the Chagall or more than a dozen other artworks that would appear to have been official gifts but have been exhibited as part of the Windsors\u2019 personal or private collections. \u201cIt is incorrect to suggest that the artworks you list were all official gifts,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe would not comment on the value of works of art.\u201d A Monet worth millions A watercolour artist himself, King Charles III is an aficionado of fine art. The four floors of his London residence, Clarence House, are filled with artwork, much of which is unequivocally the private property of the Windsors. Charles can largely thank his grandmother for the art adorning the walls of Clarence House. An avid private collector, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother bought dozens of valuable artworks between the 1930s and 1950s, when prices were lower because of the war, and bargains could be found in the frequent country house sales of the time. Over the years, the queen mother filled Clarence House, then her London residence, with a collection worthy of any great gallery, although its presentation was more homely. In the corner of the Morning Room, behind a side table covered with family photographs and the shade of a table lamp, hangs what is probably the most valuable of all the art in the royals\u2019 private collection: Claude Monet\u2019s Study of Rocks; Creuse: Le Bloc. The painting was bought by the queen mother in 1945, at the Wildenstein gallery in Paris. The second world war had dampened art prices and she snapped it up for \u00a32,000, the equivalent of \u00a3110,000 today. Susan Orringe, of Prestige Valuations, told the Guardian the painting could fetch up to \u00a320m if it were sold today. However, she clarified that the estimated price was highly speculative and the paucity of Monets on the market, coupled with the fact that it had hung for decades in the queen mother\u2019s front room, could raise its value much higher. Clarence House, which used to be open to the public, has been closed since 2019. The Monet and other artworks can be seen in a virtual tour of the residence. The artworks also include Fylde Farm by LS Lowry, worth about \u00a3120,000, and a portrait of George Bernard Shaw by Augustus John, worth about \u00a370,000. Elsewhere in the house are multiple other works, including paintings by Paul Nash, Raffaellino del Garbo and Alfred Sisley. The Eve of St Agnes by John Everett Millais, which the queen mother bought at auction in 1942 for \u00a3630, could be worth about \u00a31.5m today. Charles moved into Clarence House in 2003, after the death of the queen mother the previous year. He has previously said that among his favourite works are a moody series of paintings of Windsor Castle by John Piper. They hang on the wall of his dining room. The queen mother paid \u00a310 each for them (equivalent to \u00a3646 in today\u2019s money). Today the set could be worth \u00a3150,000. It is assumed Charles has inherited almost all of the artwork previously owned by the queen mother, the queen and Prince Philip. As monarch, he is exempt from the inheritance tax that would be due on any high-value bequests to his siblings. However, it is impossible to know precisely who owns which pieces in the Windsors\u2019 private collection, and how much it may all be worth. The Guardian consulted experts on the value of 60 of the most significant works on a list of 392 identified as being privately owned by the Windsors. The total value of the 60 was estimated to be at least \u00a324m. But that valuation is based on only a fraction of a much larger collection. In 2020, the historian David McClure estimated that the queen mother\u2019s private collection, said to have comprised 1,200 prints, paintings and drawings, was worth \u00a330m. He concluded that Prince Philip\u2019s collection, said to include more than 1,500 items, was worth \u00a32m. In 2001, the art expert Robin Simon valued the queen\u2019s collection for the Mail on Sunday and concluded it was worth \u00a3150m (the equivalent of \u00a3261m today). That would suggest the Windsors\u2019 private collection could be worth more than \u00a3290m. However, the lack of any public register of these works means all of these estimates are speculative. It is impossible to say anything with certainty about the value of the private art collection, although there is no doubt it is worth many millions of pounds. Dal\u00ed and Freud The value of the private collection matters because while much of the Windsors\u2019 private art is unequivocally theirs, some of it might be better described as belonging to the nation. The royal policy on accepting gifts states that items presented on official duties, by people not considered close personal friends, \u201care not the private property of the member of the royal family who receives them\u201d. More than a third of the 392 pieces identified by the Guardian in private royal collections appear to have been gifts of one sort or another. Some were wedding presents, while others were official gifts on overseas trips, including from artists themselves. All were displayed in exhibitions of \u201cpersonal\u201d art collections. None are part of the public royal collection. One such instance was a gift from the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dal\u00ed, whom Philip met in 1972 while staying near Avignon on a state visit to the south of France. Not much is known about that meeting, but at some point Dal\u00ed presented Philip with an etching called Hommage, as well as a special edition of his book adorned with sketches in ballpoint pen. Those gifts could be worth in the region of \u00a310,000 today. Philip included them in an exhibition of work described as his personal collection in 1994. An infamous portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Lucian Freud is another example of a direct gift from an artist. The 2001 work divided opinion, prompting the Sun\u2019s royal photographer Arthur Edwards to declare: \u201cFreud should be locked in the Tower [of London] for this.\u201d But it would appear that the queen liked it enough to adopt it as part of her personal collection. The small oil painting has now passed into the possession of the king, who loaned it to a Freud exhibition late last year. The painting joins another by Freud, Small Fern, which was given to Charles for his 50th birthday in 1998 and exhibited as one of his privately owned works in 2018. Oils by Freud are considered extremely valuable; Orringe estimated the botanical painting could fetch up to \u00a3600,000. Other artworks given to the royals on state visits include a watercolour of an Australian bird by Carol O\u2019Connor, presented to Philip on an official visit to Perth in 1990; an acrylic on masonite of pelicans by Robert Bateman, given to Philip in 1987 to mark 100 years of national parks in Canada; both were exhibited as part of Prince Philip\u2019s \u201cpersonal collection\u201d. A watercolour painting by Charles Decimus Barraud, given to the queen mother by the mayor of Auckland, New Zealand, in 1958 was included in a list of her collection, which passed to the queen on her death. In their statement, the palace spokesperson did not shed any light on whether specific artworks exhibited in private collections were regarded as official or personal gifts. \u201cOfficial gifts are not the personal property of the member of the royal family who receives them, but may be held by the sovereign in right of the crown or designated in due course as part of the royal collection,\u201d they said. \u201cEven when works of art are privately held by members of the royal family, they are frequently lent to public exhibitions.\u201d The palace declined to say why none of the artworks were contained in the royal collection. Haggling over prices The royal collection contains 5,600 paintings, including works by Mantegna, Rubens, Rembrandt and Canaletto. The royals have the privilege of borrowing items in the collection free of charge to hang in their private residences, while others appear in Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace. But Philip, who married into the monarchy with very little wealth of his own, was said to have found the art of the royal collection stuffy. Unimpressed, he began to collect more contemporary artists, perhaps drawing on his wife\u2019s funds to do so. \u201cWe could have borrowed, of course,\u201d he said in a 1994 interview with the Scotsman, \u201cbut I thought it would be more fun to have our own.\u201d Of the 392 works identified by the Guardian, 80 were bought privately by either Philip or the queen mother \u2013 and are, in that sense, indisputably theirs. Philip, in particular, liked a bargain, boasting of his James Morrison oil paintings: \u201cI bought them, I don\u2019t know, for \u00a31,000 or something. I don\u2019t know what he charges now, about \u00a330,000 or something.\u201d (The record price for a Morrison was set in 2014 at \u00a381,000.) Letters between Philip and Feliks Topolski, a Polish-born artist whom he considered a friend, show Philip haggling over the price of an equestrian portrait for two years. He eventually drove down the price and got the work for \u00a3834 \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a312,000 in today\u2019s money. This was a 63% discount on what experts had told him it should be worth. Philip and the queen mother are known to have taken advantage of trips to the Commonwealth to add to their private collections, which, for example, contain 27 works by Australian and Indigenous artists. The most valuable of those is Home Leave by Russell Drysdale, which was acquired by the queen mother and is now worth an estimated \u00a31.7m. Philip bought works by Sidney Nolan and was given two paintings by William Dobell, which together are now worth in the region of \u00a3570,000. Jane Raffan, an Australian art expert and valuer, said that in the 1950s and 60s royal visitors behaved like \u201cupper-level tourists in that they were looking to acquire something, a souvenir from their trip, but they were not buying something from a tourist tat shop \u2026 in many ways it was a case of right time and place in regard to the Dobells, the Nolans and the Drysdales.\u201d \u2018I cannot resist it\u2019 Another blurred line around the Windsors\u2019 private collection relates to works produced by artists who accompany them on official tours. Philip befriended Edward Seago over the years and the Norfolk-based artist gave him and the queen mother many paintings. Sixty of those came from a trip Seago took with Philip on the Royal Yacht Britannia, when, after a state visit to Australia in 1956, they sailed on to the Antarctic. \u201cHe painted all these pictures and said: \u2018You can have them\u2019,\u201d Philip told the Scotsman newspaper. While the two men were friends at that point, the paintings were made and presented as part of an official royal trip. Yet none of them are in the royal collection. The trove of oils passed to the royals by Seago could now be worth as much as \u00a32.6m. Charles has also been known to take artists on royal tours overseas; a palace spokesperson stressed they were \u201cpersonally funded\u201d by him. Artists including John Ward, Susannah Fiennes, Robbie Wraith and Warwick Fuller accompanied Charles, when he was Prince of Wales, to various destinations, from Oman to South Africa. In 1989, Charles explicitly said that the practice of taking artists with him overseas would benefit the public collection of art held in trust for the benefit of the nation. \u201cIt is such a good way of providing a record, adding to the royal collection, obtaining some tips on painting, and meeting other artists, that I cannot resist it,\u201d he said. The Guardian has identified 25 pieces produced by artists on such foreign trips. None are in the royal collection. They have, presumably, been incorporated into the king\u2019s private assets. Buckingham Palace declined to say where they were being kept, or why they were not in the royal collection. The locations of the works given to the royal family by Dal\u00ed, Chagall and Freud also remain a mystery.", "charCount": "14437", "shouldHideReaderRevenue": "false", "showAffiliateLinks": "false", "bylineHtml": "<a href=\"profile/maeve-mcclenaghan\">Maeve McClenaghan</a> Investigations correspondent", "showTableOfContents": "false"}, "tags": [{"id": "uk/monarchy", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webTitle": "Monarchy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/monarchy", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/monarchy", "references": []}, {"id": "uk/prince-charles", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webTitle": "King Charles III", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-charles", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-charles", "references": []}, {"id": "uk/queen", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webTitle": "Queen Elizabeth II", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/queen", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/queen", "references": []}, {"id": "uk/prince-philip", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webTitle": "Prince Philip", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-philip", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-philip", "references": []}, {"id": "uk/queenmother", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webTitle": "Queen Mother", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/queenmother", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/queenmother", "references": []}, {"id": "artanddesign/artanddesign", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "artanddesign", "sectionName": "Art and design", "webTitle": "Art and design", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artanddesign", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/artanddesign", "references": [{"id": "rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email", "type": "rich-link"}]}, {"id": "culture/culture", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "culture", "sectionName": "Culture", "webTitle": "Culture", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture", "references": []}, {"id": "uk/uk", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webTitle": "UK news", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk", "references": [{"id": "rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk", "type": "rich-link"}]}, {"id": "uk-news/series/cost-of-the-crown", "type": "series", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webTitle": "Cost of the crown", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/series/cost-of-the-crown", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/series/cost-of-the-crown", "references": [], "description": "<p>An investigation into royal wealth and finances</p>"}, {"id": "type/article", "type": "type", "webTitle": "Article", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/articles", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article", "references": []}, {"id": "tone/news", "type": "tone", "webTitle": "News", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news", "references": []}, {"id": "tone/features", "type": "tone", "webTitle": "Features", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features", "references": []}, {"id": "profile/maeve-mcclenaghan", "type": "contributor", "webTitle": "Maeve McClenaghan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/maeve-mcclenaghan", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/maeve-mcclenaghan", "references": [], "bio": "<p>Maeve McClenaghan is an investigations correspondent for the Guardian.

It was 1960 and the pair had just met at a ceremony where Chagall was presented with the prestigious Erasmus prize. Philip would later recall the artist\u2019s \u201cjocular attitude\u201d as he showed him around his exhibition.</p> <p>\u201cHe gave me this Bible he has illustrated, just out of the blue. He was a very strange man,\u201d Philip reportedly said. It was also something of a strange gift. Inside the Bible, Chagall had daubed colourful illustrations in watercolours, chalk and ink. Those two illustrations could now be worth as much as \u00a360,000.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffaabfc8f6de80dd694e32abe14f603e57f10b2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffaabfc8f6de80dd694e32abe14f603e57f10b2d/59_27_3973_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Image from Chagall\u2019s Bible given to Prince Philip.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"739\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Image from Chagall\u2019s Bible given to Prince Philip.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: His Majesty King Charles III 2023</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As contemporary artworks go, that is not a huge sum. However, the Chagall Bible is one of an extraordinary collection of almost 400 artworks, some worth much more, that have been exhibited by the Windsors in \u201cpersonal\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d collections.</p> <p>They are, in total, likely to be worth tens of millions of pounds, possibly more, and include pieces by Salvador Dal\u00ed, LS Lowry, Claude Monet and Lucian Freud.</p> <p>Many of the items, however, raise questions for the Windsors about whether all of these artworks should really belong to them. </p> <p>Royal art can broadly be separated into two categories. Most of it is part of the royal collection, more than a million items that are held in trust by the sovereign for the benefit of the nation. Described as one of the greatest art collections in the world, it is the nearest the UK has to a public custodian of royal-linked art.</p> <p>The second, much more elusive category is that which the royals treat as their own: the Windsors\u2019 private collection. There is no public register of these works and Buckingham Palace refuses to comment in any detail on what it regards as private wealth. However, items such as the Chagall Bible raise questions about what falls under that definition.</p> <p>Not in the royal collection, the artwork casually given to Philip on a state visit appears to have been absorbed into his own collection. At a special exhibition in Holyrood Palace in 1994, the Chagall piece was on display as part of the prince\u2019s \u201cpersonal collection\u201d.</p> <p>Buckingham Palace\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/07/what-are-the-rules-on-gifts-for-the-royal-family\">gift policy</a>, introduced the following year, distinguishes between \u201cofficial gifts\u201d, which are generally those received in the course of formal duties and functions, and \u201cpersonal gifts\u201d, from people whom members of the royal family know personally. The policy adds: \u201cIn all cases, and particularly on official overseas trips, organisations and individuals should be discouraged from offering extravagant gifts, ie gifts of high monetary value.\u201d</p> <p>Contacted by the Guardian, the palace declined to comment on the ownership status of the Chagall or more than a dozen other artworks that would appear to have been official gifts but have been exhibited as part of the Windsors\u2019 personal or private collections. \u201cIt is incorrect to suggest that the artworks you list were all official gifts,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe would not comment on the value of works of art.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>A Monet worth millions</strong></h2> <p>A watercolour artist himself, King Charles III is an aficionado of fine art.<strong> </strong>The four floors of his London residence, Clarence House, are filled with artwork, much of which is unequivocally the private property of the Windsors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1458aaefe7828e2fbfc71c9835725ce445e362c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1458aaefe7828e2fbfc71c9835725ce445e362c/0_0_2795_1677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"TV presenter Claire Balding (L) talks to Camilla, the Queen Consort, during an event at Clarence House in April 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">TV presenter Claire Balding (L) talks to Camilla, the Queen Consort, during an event at Clarence House in April 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Charles can largely thank his grandmother for the art adorning the walls of Clarence House. An avid private collector, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother bought dozens of valuable artworks between the 1930s and 1950s, when prices were lower because of the war, and bargains could be found in the frequent country house sales of the time.</p> <p>Over the years, the queen mother filled Clarence House, then her London residence, with a collection worthy of any great gallery, although its presentation was more homely.</p> <p>In the corner of the Morning Room, behind a side table covered with family photographs and the shade of a table lamp, hangs what is probably the most valuable of all the art in the royals\u2019 private collection: Claude Monet\u2019s Study of Rocks; Creuse: Le Bloc. The painting was bought by the queen mother in 1945, at the Wildenstein gallery in Paris. The second world war had dampened art prices and she snapped it up for \u00a32,000, the equivalent of \u00a3110,000 today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eec13dd10300d7b5746927244fdf325b8e000650\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eec13dd10300d7b5746927244fdf325b8e000650/0_0_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Camilla meeting the broadcaster Chris Evans at Clarence House in 2015 with Monet\u2019s Study of Rocks; Creuse: Le Bloc hanging on the wall behind her.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Camilla meeting the broadcaster Chris Evans at Clarence House in 2015 with Monet\u2019s Study of Rocks; Creuse: Le Bloc hanging on the wall behind her.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heathcliff O\u2019Malley/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Susan Orringe, of Prestige Valuations, told the Guardian the painting could fetch up to \u00a320m if it were sold today. However, she clarified that the estimated price was highly speculative and the paucity of Monets on the market, coupled with the fact that it had hung for decades in the queen mother\u2019s front room, could raise its value much higher.</p> <p>Clarence House, which used to be open to the public, has been closed since 2019. The Monet and other artworks can be seen in a <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/story/inside-clarence-house-clarence-house/dgXRGpeByJlLJg?hl=en-GB\">virtual tour</a> of the residence.</p> <p>The artworks also include Fylde Farm by LS Lowry, worth about \u00a3120,000, and a portrait of George Bernard Shaw by Augustus John, worth about \u00a370,000<strong>. </strong>Elsewhere in the house are multiple other works, including paintings by Paul Nash, Raffaellino del Garbo and Alfred Sisley. The Eve of St Agnes by John Everett Millais, which the queen mother bought at auction in 1942 for \u00a3630, could be worth about \u00a31.5m today.</p> <p>Charles moved into Clarence House in 2003, after the death of the queen mother the previous year. He has previously said that among his favourite works are a moody series of paintings of Windsor Castle by John Piper. They hang on the wall of his dining room. The queen mother paid \u00a310 each for them (equivalent to \u00a3646 in today\u2019s money). Today the set could be worth \u00a3150,000.</p> <p>It is assumed Charles has inherited almost all of the artwork previously owned by the queen mother, the queen and Prince Philip. As monarch, he is exempt from the inheritance tax that would be due on any high-value bequests to his siblings.</p> <p>However, it is impossible to know precisely who owns which pieces in the Windsors\u2019 private collection, and how much it may all be worth. </p> <p>The Guardian consulted experts on the value of 60 of the most significant works on a list of 392 identified as being privately owned by the Windsors. The total value of the 60 was estimated to be at least \u00a324m. But that valuation is based on only a fraction of a much larger collection.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a58417ce-9d40-4395-ab38-0bf2ace661d9\"         data-atom-type=\"guide\"    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <p>In 2020, the historian David McClure estimated that the queen mother\u2019s private collection, said to have comprised 1,200 prints, paintings and drawings, was worth \u00a330m. He concluded that Prince Philip\u2019s collection, said to include more than 1,500 items, was worth \u00a32m. In 2001, the art expert Robin Simon valued the queen\u2019s collection for the Mail on Sunday and concluded it was worth \u00a3150m (the equivalent of \u00a3261m today).</p> <p>That would suggest the Windsors\u2019 private collection could be worth more than \u00a3290m. However, the lack of any public register of these works means all of these estimates are speculative. It is impossible to say anything with certainty about the value of the private art collection, although there is no doubt it is worth many millions of pounds.</p> <h2><strong>Dal\u00ed and Freud</strong></h2> <p>The value of the private collection matters because while much of the Windsors\u2019 private art is unequivocally theirs, some of it might be better described as belonging to the nation. The royal policy on accepting gifts states that items presented on official duties, by people not considered close personal friends, \u201care not the private property of the member of the royal family who receives them\u201d.</p> <p>More than a third of the 392 pieces identified by the Guardian in private royal collections appear to have been gifts of one sort or another. Some were wedding presents, while others were official gifts on overseas trips, including from artists themselves. All were displayed in exhibitions of \u201cpersonal\u201d art collections. None are part of the public royal collection.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"415a0a6f9e9fcf05e6e4119899717453acd4ab11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/415a0a6f9e9fcf05e6e4119899717453acd4ab11/0_0_4135_2481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charles presents the Prince of Wales medals for arts philanthropy at Clarence House in November 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charles presents the Prince of Wales medals for arts philanthropy at Clarence House in November 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anwar Hussein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One such instance was a gift from the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dal\u00ed, whom Philip met in 1972 while staying near Avignon on a state visit to the south of France. Not much is known about that meeting, but at some point Dal\u00ed presented Philip with an etching called Hommage, as well as a special edition of his book adorned with sketches in ballpoint pen.</p> <p>Those gifts could be worth in the region of \u00a310,000 today. Philip included them in an exhibition of work described as his personal collection in 1994.</p> <p>An infamous portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Lucian Freud is another example of a direct gift from an artist. The 2001 work divided opinion, prompting the Sun\u2019s royal photographer Arthur Edwards to declare: \u201cFreud should be locked in the Tower [of London] for this.\u201d</p> <p>But it would appear that the queen liked it enough to adopt it as part of her personal collection.

It was 1960 and the pair had just met at a ceremony where Chagall was presented with the prestigious Erasmus prize. Philip would later recall the artist\u2019s \u201cjocular attitude\u201d as he showed him around his exhibition. \u201cHe gave me this Bible he has illustrated, just out of the blue. He was a very strange man,\u201d Philip reportedly said. It was also something of a strange gift. Inside the Bible, Chagall had daubed colourful illustrations in watercolours, chalk and ink. Those two illustrations could now be worth as much as \u00a360,000.\nAs contemporary artworks go, that is not a huge sum. However, the Chagall Bible is one of an extraordinary collection of almost 400 artworks, some worth much more, that have been exhibited by the Windsors in \u201cpersonal\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d collections. They are, in total, likely to be worth tens of millions of pounds, possibly more, and include pieces by Salvador Dal\u00ed, LS Lowry, Claude Monet and Lucian Freud. Many of the items, however, raise questions for the Windsors about whether all of these artworks should really belong to them. Royal art can broadly be separated into two categories. Most of it is part of the royal collection, more than a million items that are held in trust by the sovereign for the benefit of the nation. Described as one of the greatest art collections in the world, it is the nearest the UK has to a public custodian of royal-linked art. The second, much more elusive category is that which the royals treat as their own: the Windsors\u2019 private collection. There is no public register of these works and Buckingham Palace refuses to comment in any detail on what it regards as private wealth. However, items such as the Chagall Bible raise questions about what falls under that definition. Not in the royal collection, the artwork casually given to Philip on a state visit appears to have been absorbed into his own collection. At a special exhibition in Holyrood Palace in 1994, the Chagall piece was on display as part of the prince\u2019s \u201cpersonal collection\u201d. Buckingham Palace\u2019s gift policy, introduced the following year, distinguishes between \u201cofficial gifts\u201d, which are generally those received in the course of formal duties and functions, and \u201cpersonal gifts\u201d, from people whom members of the royal family know personally. The policy adds: \u201cIn all cases, and particularly on official overseas trips, organisations and individuals should be discouraged from offering extravagant gifts, ie gifts of high monetary value.\u201d Contacted by the Guardian, the palace declined to comment on the ownership status of the Chagall or more than a dozen other artworks that would appear to have been official gifts but have been exhibited as part of the Windsors\u2019 personal or private collections. \u201cIt is incorrect to suggest that the artworks you list were all official gifts,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe would not comment on the value of works of art.\u201d A Monet worth millions A watercolour artist himself, King Charles III is an aficionado of fine art. The four floors of his London residence, Clarence House, are filled with artwork, much of which is unequivocally the private property of the Windsors.\nCharles can largely thank his grandmother for the art adorning the walls of Clarence House. An avid private collector, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother bought dozens of valuable artworks between the 1930s and 1950s, when prices were lower because of the war, and bargains could be found in the frequent country house sales of the time. Over the years, the queen mother filled Clarence House, then her London residence, with a collection worthy of any great gallery, although its presentation was more homely. In the corner of the Morning Room, behind a side table covered with family photographs and the shade of a table lamp, hangs what is probably the most valuable of all the art in the royals\u2019 private collection: Claude Monet\u2019s Study of Rocks; Creuse: Le Bloc. The painting was bought by the queen mother in 1945, at the Wildenstein gallery in Paris. The second world war had dampened art prices and she snapped it up for \u00a32,000, the equivalent of \u00a3110,000 today.\nSusan Orringe, of Prestige Valuations, told the Guardian the painting could fetch up to \u00a320m if it were sold today. However, she clarified that the estimated price was highly speculative and the paucity of Monets on the market, coupled with the fact that it had hung for decades in the queen mother\u2019s front room, could raise its value much higher. Clarence House, which used to be open to the public, has been closed since 2019. The Monet and other artworks can be seen in a virtual tour of the residence. The artworks also include Fylde Farm by LS Lowry, worth about \u00a3120,000, and a portrait of George Bernard Shaw by Augustus John, worth about \u00a370,000. Elsewhere in the house are multiple other works, including paintings by Paul Nash, Raffaellino del Garbo and Alfred Sisley. The Eve of St Agnes by John Everett Millais, which the queen mother bought at auction in 1942 for \u00a3630, could be worth about \u00a31.5m today. Charles moved into Clarence House in 2003, after the death of the queen mother the previous year. He has previously said that among his favourite works are a moody series of paintings of Windsor Castle by John Piper. They hang on the wall of his dining room. The queen mother paid \u00a310 each for them (equivalent to \u00a3646 in today\u2019s money). Today the set could be worth \u00a3150,000. It is assumed Charles has inherited almost all of the artwork previously owned by the queen mother, the queen and Prince Philip. As monarch, he is exempt from the inheritance tax that would be due on any high-value bequests to his siblings. However, it is impossible to know precisely who owns which pieces in the Windsors\u2019 private collection, and how much it may all be worth. The Guardian consulted experts on the value of 60 of the most significant works on a list of 392 identified as being privately owned by the Windsors. The total value of the 60 was estimated to be at least \u00a324m. But that valuation is based on only a fraction of a much larger collection.\nIn 2020, the historian David McClure estimated that the queen mother\u2019s private collection, said to have comprised 1,200 prints, paintings and drawings, was worth \u00a330m. He concluded that Prince Philip\u2019s collection, said to include more than 1,500 items, was worth \u00a32m. In 2001, the art expert Robin Simon valued the queen\u2019s collection for the Mail on Sunday and concluded it was worth \u00a3150m (the equivalent of \u00a3261m today). That would suggest the Windsors\u2019 private collection could be worth more than \u00a3290m. However, the lack of any public register of these works means all of these estimates are speculative. It is impossible to say anything with certainty about the value of the private art collection, although there is no doubt it is worth many millions of pounds. Dal\u00ed and Freud The value of the private collection matters because while much of the Windsors\u2019 private art is unequivocally theirs, some of it might be better described as belonging to the nation. The royal policy on accepting gifts states that items presented on official duties, by people not considered close personal friends, \u201care not the private property of the member of the royal family who receives them\u201d. More than a third of the 392 pieces identified by the Guardian in private royal collections appear to have been gifts of one sort or another. Some were wedding presents, while others were official gifts on overseas trips, including from artists themselves. All were displayed in exhibitions of \u201cpersonal\u201d art collections. None are part of the public royal collection.\nOne such instance was a gift from the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dal\u00ed, whom Philip met in 1972 while staying near Avignon on a state visit to the south of France. Not much is known about that meeting, but at some point Dal\u00ed presented Philip with an etching called Hommage, as well as a special edition of his book adorned with sketches in ballpoint pen. Those gifts could be worth in the region of \u00a310,000 today. Philip included them in an exhibition of work described as his personal collection in 1994. An infamous portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Lucian Freud is another example of a direct gift from an artist. The 2001 work divided opinion, prompting the Sun\u2019s royal photographer Arthur Edwards to declare: \u201cFreud should be locked in the Tower [of London] for this.\u201d But it would appear that the queen liked it enough to adopt it as part of her personal collection. The small oil painting has now passed into the possession of the king, who loaned it to a Freud exhibition late last year. The painting joins another by Freud, Small Fern, which was given to Charles for his 50th birthday in 1998 and exhibited as one of his privately owned works in 2018. Oils by Freud are considered extremely valuable; Orringe estimated the botanical painting could fetch up to \u00a3600,000.\nOther artworks given to the royals on state visits include a watercolour of an Australian bird by Carol O\u2019Connor, presented to Philip on an official visit to Perth in 1990; an acrylic on masonite of pelicans by Robert Bateman, given to Philip in 1987 to mark 100 years of national parks in Canada; both were exhibited as part of Prince Philip\u2019s \u201cpersonal collection\u201d. A watercolour painting by Charles Decimus Barraud, given to the queen mother by the mayor of Auckland, New Zealand, in 1958 was included in a list of her collection, which passed to the queen on her death. In their statement, the palace spokesperson did not shed any light on whether specific artworks exhibited in private collections were regarded as official or personal gifts. \u201cOfficial gifts are not the personal property of the member of the royal family who receives them, but may be held by the sovereign in right of the crown or designated in due course as part of the royal collection,\u201d they said. \u201cEven when works of art are privately held by members of the royal family, they are frequently lent to public exhibitions.\u201d The palace declined to say why none of the artworks were contained in the royal collection.\nHaggling over prices The royal collection contains 5,600 paintings, including works by Mantegna, Rubens, Rembrandt and Canaletto. The royals have the privilege of borrowing items in the collection free of charge to hang in their private residences, while others appear in Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace. But Philip, who married into the monarchy with very little wealth of his own, was said to have found the art of the royal collection stuffy. Unimpressed, he began to collect more contemporary artists, perhaps drawing on his wife\u2019s funds to do so. \u201cWe could have borrowed, of course,\u201d he said in a 1994 interview with the Scotsman, \u201cbut I thought it would be more fun to have our own.\u201d Of the 392 works identified by the Guardian, 80 were bought privately by either Philip or the queen mother \u2013 and are, in that sense, indisputably theirs. Philip, in particular, liked a bargain, boasting of his James Morrison oil paintings: \u201cI bought them, I don\u2019t know, for \u00a31,000 or something. I don\u2019t know what he charges now, about \u00a330,000 or something.\u201d (The record price for a Morrison was set in 2014 at \u00a381,000.) Letters between Philip and Feliks Topolski, a Polish-born artist whom he considered a friend, show Philip haggling over the price of an equestrian portrait for two years. He eventually drove down the price and got the work for \u00a3834 \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a312,000 in today\u2019s money. This was a 63% discount on what experts had told him it should be worth. Philip and the queen mother are known to have taken advantage of trips to the Commonwealth to add to their private collections, which, for example, contain 27 works by Australian and Indigenous artists.\nThe most valuable of those is Home Leave by Russell Drysdale, which was acquired by the queen mother and is now worth an estimated \u00a31.7m. Philip bought works by Sidney Nolan and was given two paintings by William Dobell, which together are now worth in the region of \u00a3570,000. Jane Raffan, an Australian art expert and valuer, said that in the 1950s and 60s royal visitors behaved like \u201cupper-level tourists in that they were looking to acquire something, a souvenir from their trip, but they were not buying something from a tourist tat shop \u2026 in many ways it was a case of right time and place in regard to the Dobells, the Nolans and the Drysdales.\u201d \u2018I cannot resist it\u2019 Another blurred line around the Windsors\u2019 private collection relates to works produced by artists who accompany them on official tours.

Hands trembling, sweat fogging his goggles, he slowly assembles the explosive. A knife-blade of powder is painstakingly poured into a tiny tube. Wires are shakily glued together. With infinite care, the delicate, deadly contraption takes shape. Outside the tin shack where this is all unfolding, another young man paces, remembering his friend\u2019s instructions: \u201cDon\u2019t come in unless I tell you to. Unless you see fire.\u201d He looks as if he\u2019s about to be sick. The audience knows how he feels.</p> <p>This is the tense setup at the heart of How to Blow Up a Pipeline, a propulsive, nerve-jangling thriller about eight young people who want to send a message about the urgency of the climate crisis by sabotaging an oil pipeline. The film takes its cues from its heroes: aiming to excite audiences into action instead of hectoring them into submission. It is one hell of a ride. After its premiere at Toronto last year, the New York Times pronounced How to Blow Up a Pipeline \u201ca cultural landmark\u201d for its sympathetic take on eco-terrorism, while the Washington City Paper described its youthful cast as \u201ca much more intense, combustible version of The Breakfast Club\u201d.</p> <p>What director, co-writer and producer Daniel Goldhaber \u2013 one of its four key film-makers \u2013 wanted to make, he says via video call, was a thriller: \u201cOcean\u2019s Eleven about environmental activism.\u201d It\u2019s an ingenious pitch. Regardless of your feelings about their approach, you root for the gang to succeed as much as you do for hardened gangsters poring over blueprints to pull off a bank heist. \u201cThe idea of empathising with characters who take action like this, without ever condemning them for taking it too far, is something I don\u2019t see in the media,\u201d says Ariela Barer, who co-wrote, produced and also stars in the film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57da70ae0953ca2cce30850c8927a456ed88ed7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57da70ae0953ca2cce30850c8927a456ed88ed7b/21_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I only get to be 49?\u2019 \u2026 Ariela Barer in the film.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I only get to be 49?\u2019 \u2026 Ariela Barer in the film.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pair first had the idea for the project while isolating in an LA apartment in January 2021. Their other flatmate, co-writer Jordan Sjol, had got hold of a book provocatively entitled How to Blow Up a Pipeline. It was a manifesto by Swedish academic Andreas Malm that made a rousing case for property destruction as a tactic in the pursuit of climate justice. The volume was excitedly passed around. Goldhaber had the idea of dramatising its ideas, turning them into a movie. But how to adapt a work of theory into a mainstream blockbuster? None of them wanted to make a hand-wringing documentary, or an apocalyptic disaster flick in the mould of The Day After Tomorrow or Don\u2019t Look Up. They wanted it to be credible, but also appealing \u2013 optimistic even.</p> <p>For Goldhaber, films that now possess that last quality tend to have major vested interests \u2013 and budgets to match. \u201cWe have traded the ability for hopeful moviemaking for movies like Top Gun,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is a good piece of film-making but undoubtedly a piece of American military propaganda.\u201d Yet tapping into the same emotional beats \u2013 underdog narrative, heart-pounding action \u2013 and using them to talk about acts of sabotage and resistance is, he says, \u201ca totally valid and important thing for the progressive movement to engage with\u201d. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Dakota Access Pipeline activists did everything right \u2013 and nothing happened. The pipeline got built</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s true: watching the gang plant the explosive, or Michael, the young man in that pivotal scene, cook it up in the first place, the job at the centre of How to Blow Up a Pipeline shares more DNA with tense Hollywood heist movies like Thief or Inside Man. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is pretty dangerous,\u201d says the film\u2019s editor Daniel Garber, who rounds out the quartet, each of them<strong> </strong>billed equally in the credits as makers (like their characters, they are a collective). \u201cThat\u2019s what provokes this stomach-churning feeling of, \u2018Oh my God, are they going to blow themselves up?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Once you create a certain level of tension, he says, it buys you time to digress. \u201cThe heist,\u201d he adds, \u201cis a Trojan horse into which we can sneak all of these other concepts.\u201d Those concepts are explored in flashbacks, each one detailing how the individual characters came to be involved with the cause.</p> <p>The team spent two months interviewing climate activists and pipeline experts about their experiences. Some became characters. Clarissa Thibeaux, Barer\u2019s friend and a credited consultant, partly inspired Theo, played by American Honey\u2019s Sasha Lane, whose leukaemia diagnosis she ascribes to growing up near to a chemical plant. They also drew from the story of <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/dakota-access-pipeline-eco-sabotage-jessica-reznicek-ruby-montoya-1173735/\">Jessica Reznicek and Ruby Montoya</a>, who were imprisoned for terrorism after they vandalised the Dakota Access Pipeline with an acetylene torch, despite there being no oil running through it.</p> <p>Barer had campaigned against its construction as a teenager. \u201cThe pipeline got built,\u201d she says, \u201cand nothing really happened, despite the activists doing everything right.\u201d This failure, after immaculate campaigning, was one of the reasons she was so drawn to Malm\u2019s book: \u201cIt felt like an unapologetic push for a radical flank.\u201d The book also detailed acts of sabotage sometimes wrongly remembered as non-violent, such as women\u2019s suffrage. \u201cReading theory like this reinvigorated me,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7307e43d0a1ad5b511a84b83efef8d3011e1cd35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7307e43d0a1ad5b511a84b83efef8d3011e1cd35/240_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A kaleidoscope\u2019 \u2026 two of the eight saboteurs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A kaleidoscope\u2019 \u2026 two of the eight saboteurs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The film-makers also wanted to more accurately represent the communities affected by the climate crisis, bringing in Indigenous actor Forrest Goodluck (who played Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s son in The Revenant) to consult on the film as well as star as bomb-maker Michael. Their on-screen ensemble is predominantly made up of people of colour and includes working-class voices, Malm\u2019s book having described movements such as Extinction Rebellion as \u201cpersistently aloof from factors of class and race\u201d.

Hands trembling, sweat fogging his goggles, he slowly assembles the explosive. A knife-blade of powder is painstakingly poured into a tiny tube. Wires are shakily glued together. With infinite care, the delicate, deadly contraption takes shape. Outside the tin shack where this is all unfolding, another young man paces, remembering his friend\u2019s instructions: \u201cDon\u2019t come in unless I tell you to. Unless you see fire.\u201d He looks as if he\u2019s about to be sick. The audience knows how he feels. This is the tense setup at the heart of How to Blow Up a Pipeline, a propulsive, nerve-jangling thriller about eight young people who want to send a message about the urgency of the climate crisis by sabotaging an oil pipeline. The film takes its cues from its heroes: aiming to excite audiences into action instead of hectoring them into submission. It is one hell of a ride. After its premiere at Toronto last year, the New York Times pronounced How to Blow Up a Pipeline \u201ca cultural landmark\u201d for its sympathetic take on eco-terrorism, while the Washington City Paper described its youthful cast as \u201ca much more intense, combustible version of The Breakfast Club\u201d. What director, co-writer and producer Daniel Goldhaber \u2013 one of its four key film-makers \u2013 wanted to make, he says via video call, was a thriller: \u201cOcean\u2019s Eleven about environmental activism.\u201d It\u2019s an ingenious pitch. Regardless of your feelings about their approach, you root for the gang to succeed as much as you do for hardened gangsters poring over blueprints to pull off a bank heist. \u201cThe idea of empathising with characters who take action like this, without ever condemning them for taking it too far, is something I don\u2019t see in the media,\u201d says Ariela Barer, who co-wrote, produced and also stars in the film. The pair first had the idea for the project while isolating in an LA apartment in January 2021. Their other flatmate, co-writer Jordan Sjol, had got hold of a book provocatively entitled How to Blow Up a Pipeline. It was a manifesto by Swedish academic Andreas Malm that made a rousing case for property destruction as a tactic in the pursuit of climate justice. The volume was excitedly passed around. Goldhaber had the idea of dramatising its ideas, turning them into a movie. But how to adapt a work of theory into a mainstream blockbuster? None of them wanted to make a hand-wringing documentary, or an apocalyptic disaster flick in the mould of The Day After Tomorrow or Don\u2019t Look Up. They wanted it to be credible, but also appealing \u2013 optimistic even. For Goldhaber, films that now possess that last quality tend to have major vested interests \u2013 and budgets to match. \u201cWe have traded the ability for hopeful moviemaking for movies like Top Gun,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is a good piece of film-making but undoubtedly a piece of American military propaganda.\u201d Yet tapping into the same emotional beats \u2013 underdog narrative, heart-pounding action \u2013 and using them to talk about acts of sabotage and resistance is, he says, \u201ca totally valid and important thing for the progressive movement to engage with\u201d. It\u2019s true: watching the gang plant the explosive, or Michael, the young man in that pivotal scene, cook it up in the first place, the job at the centre of How to Blow Up a Pipeline shares more DNA with tense Hollywood heist movies like Thief or Inside Man. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is pretty dangerous,\u201d says the film\u2019s editor Daniel Garber, who rounds out the quartet, each of them billed equally in the credits as makers (like their characters, they are a collective). \u201cThat\u2019s what provokes this stomach-churning feeling of, \u2018Oh my God, are they going to blow themselves up?\u2019\u201d Once you create a certain level of tension, he says, it buys you time to digress. \u201cThe heist,\u201d he adds, \u201cis a Trojan horse into which we can sneak all of these other concepts.\u201d Those concepts are explored in flashbacks, each one detailing how the individual characters came to be involved with the cause. The team spent two months interviewing climate activists and pipeline experts about their experiences. Some became characters. Clarissa Thibeaux, Barer\u2019s friend and a credited consultant, partly inspired Theo, played by American Honey\u2019s Sasha Lane, whose leukaemia diagnosis she ascribes to growing up near to a chemical plant. They also drew from the story of Jessica Reznicek and Ruby Montoya, who were imprisoned for terrorism after they vandalised the Dakota Access Pipeline with an acetylene torch, despite there being no oil running through it. Barer had campaigned against its construction as a teenager. \u201cThe pipeline got built,\u201d she says, \u201cand nothing really happened, despite the activists doing everything right.\u201d This failure, after immaculate campaigning, was one of the reasons she was so drawn to Malm\u2019s book: \u201cIt felt like an unapologetic push for a radical flank.\u201d The book also detailed acts of sabotage sometimes wrongly remembered as non-violent, such as women\u2019s suffrage. \u201cReading theory like this reinvigorated me,\u201d she says. The film-makers also wanted to more accurately represent the communities affected by the climate crisis, bringing in Indigenous actor Forrest Goodluck (who played Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s son in The Revenant) to consult on the film as well as star as bomb-maker Michael. Their on-screen ensemble is predominantly made up of people of colour and includes working-class voices, Malm\u2019s book having described movements such as Extinction Rebellion as \u201cpersistently aloof from factors of class and race\u201d. Goldhaber says that, while the film does acknowledge the sort of activist often criticised for skewing white and privileged, it is designed as \u201ca kaleidoscope of all the different kinds of folks involved in the movement\u201d. The idea was to offer broad access points for the audience. This also explains the film\u2019s subtly comic moments: while the characters are taken seriously, they do not do so themselves.

Hands trembling, sweat fogging his goggles, he slowly assembles the explosive. A knife-blade of powder is painstakingly poured into a tiny tube. Wires are shakily glued together. With infinite care, the delicate, deadly contraption takes shape. Outside the tin shack where this is all unfolding, another young man paces, remembering his friend\u2019s instructions: \u201cDon\u2019t come in unless I tell you to. Unless you see fire.\u201d He looks as if he\u2019s about to be sick. The audience knows how he feels. This is the tense setup at the heart of How to Blow Up a Pipeline, a propulsive, nerve-jangling thriller about eight young people who want to send a message about the urgency of the climate crisis by sabotaging an oil pipeline. The film takes its cues from its heroes: aiming to excite audiences into action instead of hectoring them into submission. It is one hell of a ride. After its premiere at Toronto last year, the New York Times pronounced How to Blow Up a Pipeline \u201ca cultural landmark\u201d for its sympathetic take on eco-terrorism, while the Washington City Paper described its youthful cast as \u201ca much more intense, combustible version of The Breakfast Club\u201d. What director, co-writer and producer Daniel Goldhaber \u2013 one of its four key film-makers \u2013 wanted to make, he says via video call, was a thriller: \u201cOcean\u2019s Eleven about environmental activism.\u201d It\u2019s an ingenious pitch. Regardless of your feelings about their approach, you root for the gang to succeed as much as you do for hardened gangsters poring over blueprints to pull off a bank heist. \u201cThe idea of empathising with characters who take action like this, without ever condemning them for taking it too far, is something I don\u2019t see in the media,\u201d says Ariela Barer, who co-wrote, produced and also stars in the film.\nThe pair first had the idea for the project while isolating in an LA apartment in January 2021. Their other flatmate, co-writer Jordan Sjol, had got hold of a book provocatively entitled How to Blow Up a Pipeline. It was a manifesto by Swedish academic Andreas Malm that made a rousing case for property destruction as a tactic in the pursuit of climate justice. The volume was excitedly passed around. Goldhaber had the idea of dramatising its ideas, turning them into a movie. But how to adapt a work of theory into a mainstream blockbuster? None of them wanted to make a hand-wringing documentary, or an apocalyptic disaster flick in the mould of The Day After Tomorrow or Don\u2019t Look Up. They wanted it to be credible, but also appealing \u2013 optimistic even. For Goldhaber, films that now possess that last quality tend to have major vested interests \u2013 and budgets to match. \u201cWe have traded the ability for hopeful moviemaking for movies like Top Gun,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is a good piece of film-making but undoubtedly a piece of American military propaganda.\u201d Yet tapping into the same emotional beats \u2013 underdog narrative, heart-pounding action \u2013 and using them to talk about acts of sabotage and resistance is, he says, \u201ca totally valid and important thing for the progressive movement to engage with\u201d.\nIt\u2019s true: watching the gang plant the explosive, or Michael, the young man in that pivotal scene, cook it up in the first place, the job at the centre of How to Blow Up a Pipeline shares more DNA with tense Hollywood heist movies like Thief or Inside Man. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is pretty dangerous,\u201d says the film\u2019s editor Daniel Garber, who rounds out the quartet, each of them billed equally in the credits as makers (like their characters, they are a collective). \u201cThat\u2019s what provokes this stomach-churning feeling of, \u2018Oh my God, are they going to blow themselves up?\u2019\u201d Once you create a certain level of tension, he says, it buys you time to digress. \u201cThe heist,\u201d he adds, \u201cis a Trojan horse into which we can sneak all of these other concepts.\u201d Those concepts are explored in flashbacks, each one detailing how the individual characters came to be involved with the cause.

There were also marble-lined treading areas where enslaved workers would stamp down the newly harvested fruit, while the emperor perhaps looked on as he feasted with his retinue.</p> <p>The winery, just beyond the city limits of Rome during antiquity, was set in what was once a landscape of orchards and agricultural lands, dotted with monumental tombs \u2013 and the villas of the super rich.</p> <p>\u201c[The Villa of the Quintilii] was an amazing mini city completed by a luxury winery for the emperor himself to indulge his Bacchic tendencies,\u201d said archaeologist Dr Emlyn Dodd, assistant director at the <a href=\"https://bsr.ac.uk/\">British School at Rome</a> and an expert on ancient wine production.

A previous upper house inquiry, launched after allegations aired in parliament by NSW Liberal MP Ray Williams about senior members of his own party, became a focal point of the recent election campaign when it sparked a manhunt for one of former premier Dominic Perrottet\u2019s brothers. A spokesperson for the premier, Chris Minns, confirmed the government would not be commencing a new public inquiry in this term of government. \u201cAt the request of Icac, the government will not be proceeding with a public inquiry into the Hills Shire council at this stage as it may impact on an investigation being conducted by the commission,\u201d the spokesperson said.

The Sunday Telegraph reported that homes of past and present NSW Liberal party members have been raided as part of the investigation, with laptops and phones seized during the raids. The matters were referred to Icac by then-premier Perrottet in June of last year after Williams alleged in NSW parliament that senior members of the Liberal party were \u201cpaid significant funds\u201d by prominent property developer Jean Nassif to install new councillors to push development applications through. Williams told parliament that the incoming members had allegedly been brought in to green-light developments from Toplace \u2013 owned by Nassif \u2013 which, he alleged, is a client of Liberal powerbroker and lobbyist Christian Ellis. Williams told parliament that, before the council elections, Nassif had \u201capparently\u201d met with Ellis and other members of the Liberal party who were \u201cpaid significant funds in order to arrange to put new councillors\u201d at the council to be \u201csupportive of future Toplace development applications\u201d. Nassif has repeatedly denied the allegations. The last parliamentary inquiry sparked a statewide manhunt for Ellis and Jean-Claude Perrottet.

I hear there are some more hockey games coming up in the next few weeks \u2026 More awards \u2026 Huh. Sarah Fillier of Canada? Yeah, she had seven goals on the tournament, but \u2026 not Knight? Or Harvey? The sequence that turned a 3-3 game, in which you\u2019d still have bet on Canada to win, into a 6-3 US win. The list \u2026. What a stunner. This young US team outscores Canada 4-0 in the third period, with three of those goals coming in a 72-second span starting with 3:10 left. Of all the world championships the US women have won, this might be the least likely. Cayla Barnes flips the puck toward the net, and it\u2019s going .. going \u2026 Claire Thompson is chasing \u2026 and it\u2019s over the line. What has happened here? You wouldn\u2019t have expected this score a few minutes ago, let alone at the beginning of the third period. EMPTY NET! Canada 3-5 US, 2:15 Canada calls timeout and then pulls Desbiens. You\u2019d have to say it wasn\u2019t her best game. Five goals on 21 shots, and she\u2019d probably like another shot at a couple of those. And now it\u2019s 101 \u2026 Passing the torch \u2026 sort of. In reverse, essentially. Caroline Harvey smashes the puck from near the blue line, and Hilary Knight gets her stick up to deflect it into the net. After some consternation from the Canadian bench but not a full-fledged challenge, the goal stands. That\u2019s a hat trick for Knight. Sometimes, great players just know it\u2019s time to make that play. Taylor Heise holds the puck out to one side. Hilary Knight, standing dead center, taps her stick on the ice, looking for the pass. She gets it and rips it. US lead. 1:19 left on the 5-on-4 power play. Canada 3-3 US, 3:52, 3rd period Caroline Harvey takes a shot, which is probably the best strategy for the anemic US power play at the moment. And \u2026 Canada repeats the key US mistake of the first period! Claire Thompson flips the puck into the stands, and it\u2019s a delay of game penalty. That\u2019ll be a 5-on-3 power play for 49 seconds, then the rest of the 5-on-4. Canada 3-3 US, 5:03, 3rd period Jenner swipes at the puck and gets Abbey Murphy instead. Barely. If any. But it\u2019s a US power play \u2013 not that it\u2019s been strong so far in this game. Canada has outshot the US 27-18. Caroline Harvey is just 20 years old, but she has moved into a tie for the scoring lead (under hockey scoring-leader rules \u2013 goals and assists count the same) with this shot. That\u2019s her fourth goal to go with nine assists. Only teammate Taylor Heise has more assists than that, with 10. Canada 3-3 US, 8:27, 3rd period The Canadian forecheck pins the US defenders back. That really shouldn\u2019t happen on your own power play. The US has done very little with the player advantage in this final. Canada 3-3 US, 9:27, 3rd period A good clearance gives Canada a chance to change, much to the relief of Renata Fast, who had lost her stick. Canada 3-3 US, 10:27, 3rd period Rattray whacks the stick out of Knight\u2019s hands, and the US gets a power play. Canada 3-3 US, 11:05, 3rd period Frankel with the absolute robbery on Jenner, who was on her doorstep looking for the hat trick. The US goalie is making a difference now. Canada 3-3 US, 11:30, 3rd period Good save from Frankel on Sarah Fillier. And give credit to the refs for being consistent \u2013 there\u2019s no call on a possible penalty near the boards. That would\u2019ve given Canada a 5-on-3. But if they\u2019re not giving it for the Maltais slam in the second period, they\u2019re not giving it there. And the US gets the penalty kill. Game is nicely poised here. Canada 3-3 US, 13:46, 3rd period And just like that, a completely unnecessary trip by Cayla Barnes, and Canada is back on the power play. Caroline Harvey, the youngest player on the team in the last Olympics, rips one from way outside, and out of nothing, we\u2019re tied. Canada 3-2 US, 14:50, 3rd period The referees have been letting play continue when the puck is stuck along the boards. We\u2019ll see if they feel the same way after one of their number is stuck in the scrum. CROSSBAR! Canada 3-2 US, 16:24, 3rd period A resounding \u201cding\u201d provides some brief relief for the US on a shot by Jamie Lee Rattray. Another 30 seconds, and the US gets a much-needed penalty kill. Canada 3-2 US, 18:26, 3rd period Power play for Canada. A lot of sloppy contact in the middle of the rink, and the refs decide Hayley Scamurra took it too far. Two minutes for tripping. Canada 3-2 US, 19:00, 3rd period We\u2019re off, and the Canadians again look like the livelier side. The score reflects the balance of play pretty well. The US is playing hard. Canada is playing smart. We\u2019ll see if the US shakes off the non-call on the Emma Maltais hit on Haley Winn. That seemed to sap the underdog\u2019s energy. Canada 3-2 US, 0:51, 2nd period That\u2019s twice in a few minutes that the Canadian forecheck has given Lee Stecklein and Savannah Harmon some uncomfortable moments deep in their own zone. That\u2019s disconcerting if you\u2019re looking for the US to slam the door and keep the lead at one. Canada 3-2 US, 1:55, 2nd period Sometimes, a hockey team reacts to a big hit on one of its players with a big surge in intensity. That has not happened here. The US has plenty of possession but is playing as if they\u2019ve shifted down a gear or two. And as I say that, the college line creates a nice chance, with Heise and Janecke combining. Canada 3-2 US, 5:09, 2nd period If you like outstanding defensive plays by attacking players, you\u2019ll love Poulin\u2019s deft move to skate back, catch up with Knight and sneak her stick past to take the puck away. If you like hard checks \u2026 er, \u201ccollisions,\u201d as the commentators say \u2026 you\u2019ll like what Emma Maltais just did to fellow collegian Haley Winn. That\u2019s a borderline boarding penalty in the NHL, but apparently not here. Hannah Bilka has a few words for the Canadian Buckeye. And Jenner\u2019s brace \u2026 followed by \u2026 Catching up on highlights \u2026 here\u2019s Knight\u2019s equalizer: Canada 3-2 US, 7:23, 2nd period Slightly more than halfway through the game, and this isn\u2019t a surprise \u2013 Canadian savvy 3, US speed 2. Shots are now 18-13 for Canada, though several shots came on the 5-on-3 power play in the first period from which the US is still digging out. Renata Fast slides the puck straight through the middle toward the net, hoping for a redirection. She gets it from Brianna Jenner. The US veterans come through. Amanda Kessel races through for a 2-on-1. Canadian defender Ella Shelton sprawls, but Kessel patiently scoots past her and puts a pass right on Hilary Knight\u2019s stick, and the captain forces it past Desbiens from inches away. Canada 2-1 US, 12:35, 2nd period Close-range effort from the US, but the angle isn\u2019t there. Desbiens is taking some unnecessary chances behind her own net, as if she doesn\u2019t realize how fast these US attackers really are. Put a pin in that. Canada 2-1 US, 13:32, 2nd period Haven\u2019t said much about US goalie Aerin Frankel so far, though she made a tricky save a couple of minutes ago. She comes up big again as Rebecca Johnston is inexplicably left alone just a few feet away from the net. That penalty kill gave Canada quite a spark, and they rattled off several shots at the other end in the next minute. After some frenetic action in front of the goal, the puck goes back to Brianne Jenner, who has roughly seven players from both teams in a straight line between her and the net. She finds the seam, and Canada retakes the lead. Canada 1-1 US, 16:00, 2nd period The experienced Canadians manage to kill large chunks of the power play by pinning the puck along the boards. Taylor Heise has two venomous shots, but Desbiens pushes them away. Canada 1-1 US, 18:00, 2nd period Two big US chances early. Hilary Knight ends up with the puck just a few feet away from the net but gets tangled up. Then Hannah Bilka streaks ahead to lead a 2-on-1 that\u2019s well-defended. US has already outshot Canada 3-1 in the period. And the pressure pays off with a power play. Blayre Turnbull is called for tripping. Canada 1-1 US, 19:49, 2nd period Away we go, and Canada gets the early half-chance. Canadian soccer great Diana Matheson had a nice view of Poulin\u2019s goal \u2026 Here\u2019s the Murphy goal. Quality. Tied up 1-1. Shots even at 6-6. Give the US a bit of an edge in even-strength play. Hint for the second period: Don\u2019t give up a 5-on-3 power play. The equalizer starts with a strong defensive play by Rory Guilday. Then Alex Carpenter flips it ahead, and Minnesota collegian Abbey Murphy is off to the races. She still has a defender with her, but she cleverly pulls it back and creates space to fire it past Desbiens. Canada 1-0 US, 3:00, 1st period For what might be the first time in the game, one team has prolonged possession. It\u2019s the US in the Canadian zone, but they\u2019re unable to convert to find the key pass. Canada 1-0 US, 4:05, 1st period Canada\u2019s Claire Thompson has all day to shoot but can\u2019t get it on goal. We\u2019re still stuck at 6-5 on shots, in Canada\u2019s favor. Canada 1-0 US, 5:40, 1st period A good spell for the US but not another clear-cut chance to score. The opening goal \u2026 Canada 1-0 US, 9:06, 1st period Great chance for the US, but Desbiens keeps it level, even if she has to push her own teammate out of the way to keep the puck away from any US players looking for a rebound. Canada 1-0 US, 10:00, 1st period The officials are letting them play, as the saying often goes. US players who have just been deposited onto their backsides may disagree that they\u2019re getting a chance to play. But that\u2019s what an experience gap can bring about. Canada may have a much better sense of what will be tolerated in a big final like this in a sport that theoretically doesn\u2019t allow the same type of checking that\u2019s allowed in the men\u2019s game. Theoretically. Canada 1-0 US, 11:50, 1st period The good news for the US: Canada wasn\u2019t able to score again on the power play. Canada has taken a 6-2 edge on shots. Eden with a huge mistake, flipping the puck up and over the boards. Delay of game. Another player to the box. 5-on-3 power play. And before I can pass along that news, Canada works the puck around to, of course, Poulin. 1-0. Canada 0-0 US, 14:35, 1st period Maybe the US is going too fast. They\u2019re lucky not to be punished on a giveaway in their own zone, and then they\u2019re quite obviously offside. And we have a penalty. Hayley Scamurra goes to the box for hooking, and Canada is on the power play. POST! Canada 0-0 US, 15:07, 1st period After a faceoff accompanied by the PA system blaring Mr. Brightside, the Killers\u2019 ode to infidelity, the US controls again. Eden gets another shot and forces Desbiens\u2019 second save. But the puck falls just behind the Canadian goalie and nearly trickles in. Canada follows up with its first shot. Canada 0-0 US, 16:47, 1st period A US turnover, but Canada fails to punish it, drifting offside. Canada 0-0 US, 18:00 1st period And another good chance for the US, as Kelly Pannek emerges from a center-ice scrum and bears down on goal. She passes to the collegian Lacey Eden, who fumbles the opportunity. Canada 0-0 US, 19:00, 1st period A blazing start for the US, with Hilary Knight zipping through the Canadian zone for an early shot stopped by the hyperexperienced Ann-Marie Desbiens. Quick history lesson \u2026 Canada won the first eight world championships: 1990, 1992, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2004. The surprise in that run: The US won the inaugural Olympic gold in 1998. The US took its first world title in 2005. Canada reclaimed the mantle in 2007, following its second straight Olympic gold. Then followed a decade of US dominance, winning eight of the next nine: 2008, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019. The US also won Olympic gold in 2018, breaking Canada\u2019s streak of four straight. But Canada has taken the last two world championships and the 2022 Olympic gold. Puck drop! Canada can counter with collegiate stars, though. Princeton\u2019s Sarah Fillier is the leading goal-scorer in the tournament with seven goals in six games. Emma Maltais was on the Ohio State team that lost to Wisconsin in the NCAA final. But US fans may be more likely to fear Marie-Philip Poulin, who is happier to stick the dagger in the US like Arya Stark facing off with the Night King. She scored the overtime winner in 2021 and netted twice in the 2022 Olympic final, becoming the first hockey player to score in four straight Olympic finals. Four weeks ago, four US players celebrated a championship. Caroline Harvey, Britta Curl, Lacey Eden and Nicole LaMantia won the NCAA championship with Wisconsin, which tends to win a lot of national championships. (LaMantia is not in uniform tonight.) Plenty of their national teammates were also chasing a collegiate championship, as were three Canadian players. (For those in Canada, because it came up in one of my last live appearances \u2013 \u201ccollege\u201d means \u201cuniversity.\u201d) The US team has a potent forward line (see lineup below) of Penn State teen phenom Tessa Janecke, Minnesota center (centre) Taylor Heise and Boston College\u2019s Hannah Bilke. Every player on these two teams played at a US college (university) at some point. Many a US college roster has included players from both sides of the border. But it\u2019s a bit unusual for one team to have so many players who are also in college. Those who don\u2019t remember the past, we\u2019re told, are condemned to repeat it. US women\u2019s hockey coach John Wroblewski is banking on the opposite. After three straight losses to Canada in world championship or Olympic finals, the worst run for the US since Canada\u2019s dominance of the sport\u2019s first 15 years (1998 Olympics notwithstanding), Wroblekski has embarked on a youth movement. Maybe his players don\u2019t remember winning Olympic gold in 2018 or the world championship in 2019, the only world championship final Canada has ever missed, but they also don\u2019t remember losing in the 2021 worlds, the 2022 Olympics or the fall 2022 worlds. It\u2019s not a total clearout by any means. Eight-time world champion Hilary Knight is still here to captain the US. Fellow 30something Amanda Kessel is also in the attack. Alternate captains Alex Carpenter and Lee Stecklein are no stranger to this stage. But the goaltender is no longer Maddie Rooney, who played well beyond her 20 years to win gold in 2018, or Alex Cavallini, the 2022 goalie. It\u2019s 23-year-old Aerin Frankel. The Canadian team, on the other hand, boasts several of the all-time greats. Ann-Renee Desbiens. Marie-Philip Poulin. Jocelyn Larocque. You\u2019d think Canada would have the edge here. But their matchup earlier in these championships went to a shootout, with Canada scraping by to win. And the young, feisty US absolutely demolished Czechia, which won the bronze medal earlier today, with a 9-1 decision in the semis, as mentioned below. Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s a look back at the United States\u2019 semi-final win over the Czech Republic.", "charCount": "15379", "shouldHideReaderRevenue": "false", "showAffiliateLinks": "false", "bylineHtml": "<a href=\"profile/beau-dure\">Beau Dure</a>", "showTableOfContents": "false"}, "tags": [{"id": "sport/ice-hockey", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "sport", "sectionName": "Sport", "webTitle": "Ice hockey", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ice-hockey", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/ice-hockey", "references": []}, {"id": "sport/sport", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "sport", "sectionName": "Sport", "webTitle": "Sport", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport", "references": []}, {"id": "sport/us-sport", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "sport", "sectionName": "Sport", "webTitle": "US sports", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/us-sport", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/us-sport", "references": []}, {"id": "type/article", "type": "type", "webTitle": "Article", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/articles", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article", "references": []}, {"id": "tone/minutebyminute", "type": "tone", "webTitle": "Minute by minute", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/minutebyminute", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/minutebyminute", "references": []}, {"id": "tone/news", "type": "tone", "webTitle": "News", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news", "references": []}, {"id": "profile/beau-dure", "type": "contributor", "webTitle": "Beau Dure", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/beau-dure", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/beau-dure", "references": [], "bio": "<p>Beau Dure is a northern Virginia-based writer and the author of three books on soccer.

Erin Longbottom, counsel assisting the inquiry into the Australian Capital Territory criminal justice system\u2019s handling of the case, made that submission on Monday morning at the inquiry\u2019s first hearing. Lehrmann has denied raping Higgins and pleaded not guilty to a charge of sexual intercourse without consent. His first trial was abandoned due to juror misconduct and the director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, decided not to pursue a second due to fears for Higgins\u2019 mental health. On Monday Longbottom told the inquiry, presided over by a retired judge of the Queensland court of appeal, Walter Sofronoff, that it was \u201cimportant to emphasise that this is not an inquiry into the allegations made by Ms Higgins against Mr Lehrmann\u201d. Rather it would consider the conduct of ACT police, the DPP and the victims of crime commissioner in the performance of their duties, she said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Longbottom noted that the Lehrmann prosecution had drawn \u201cintense media and public interest\u201d in part because the alleged offence occurred at Parliament House but also because it came at \u201ca time of intense public discussion about sexual violence against women, [and] in light of the #MeToo movement. \u201cAnd, specifically in the ACT, media reports of low rates of sexual assault trials and convictions despite increases in reports to victims\u2019 services and police. \u201cThat context seemingly affected the police charged with the responsibility of investigating allegations made against Mr Lehrmann, as well as the DPP and the victims of crime commissioner. \u201cThat context also brought into question the threshold for charging, and continuing the prosecution of an allegation of sexual intercourse without consent, and the significance of the credit of the complainant in those decisions.\u201d Longbottom noted that on 1 November Drumgold had written to the ACT chief of police, Neil Gaughan, complaining of alleged \u201cinappropriate\u201d interference by police in the case. Guardian Australia revealed the content of that letter in December, after it was released pursuant to a freedom of information request. Counsel assisting told the inquiry that the relationship between ACT police and the DPP had been \u201cbeset by tension\u201d. The \u201cpoints of conflict\u201d include: Whether it was proper for ACT police to conduct a second evidence in chief interview with Higgins on 26 May 2021; \u201cConfusion about whether Mr Lehrmann should be charged and how matters affecting the credibility of Ms Higgins were to be treated by police in deciding whether to charge Mr Lehrmann, and by the DPP in deciding whether to present an indictment\u201d; Delivery of the brief of evidence to Lehrmann\u2019s lawyers on 6 August, after he was charged but before a plea was entered, which included counselling notes about Higgins; and \u201cThe apparent close engagement\u201d between investigating officers and lawyers for Lehrmann during the trial \u201cwhich led to some distrust between police and the DPP\u201d. Longbottom said Sofronoff would be required to consider whether police and the DPP had breached their duties and, if so, to discover their reasons and motives. Counsel for parties including Drumgold, the AFP and the victims of crime commissioner all pledged to give the inquiry their full cooperation. Sofronoff asked counsel for the victims of crime commissioner if the commissioner generally accepted \u201ca person\u2019s claim to be a victim\u201d and \u201cin practical terms would only turn away a claimant if she were satisfied that person is not a victim\u201d. Counsel replied that this was broadly correct, that the commissioner offered a \u201cvictim-focused\u201d approach that is \u201cseparate from the criminal justice system\u201d. Longbottom said counsel assisting expected substantive hearings to begin on 1 May, with initial witnesses from the DPP including Drumgold.

Americans Patrick Cantlay came third at 16-under, missing the playoff by one shot, followed by Xander Schaffuele one shot further back. Fitzpatrick, the 2022 US Open champion, triumphed in the town where he spent many of his family vacations after first visiting as a six-year-old. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe,\u201d the 28-year-old from Sheffield said. \u201cI said to (caddie) Billy (Foster), it doesn\u2019t get better than this \u2013 walking down here, just looking around. It\u2019s a course I dreamed of playing when I was young.\u201d \u201cI managed to play a couple of times with my dad and yes, this one means more than anything.\u201d Fitzpatrick\u2019s family was at Harbour Town to share the victory with him. Spieth had made four birdies in the opening six holes but he missed a short putt for bogey on the par-three 14th and left the door open for Fitzpatrick. The Englishman then made birdies on the 15th and 16th to grab a share of the lead and could have won it at the death if Spieth hadn\u2019t made a tricky six-footer to force the playoff. \u201cIt was a really good round. I got off to a dream start and then just kind of hung in there for a little while and then made a nice putt to get into the playoff, and then played the playoff really well,\u201d said Spieth. \u201cSomeone was going to make a birdie. It wasn\u2019t going to be a bogey to lose that playoff the way that we were both playing today. He just did what he needed to do on 15 in, when it had been kind of me and Patrick for a little while there. He just snuck in and played some tremendous golf.\u201d", "charCount": "2402", "shouldHideReaderRevenue": "false", "showAffiliateLinks": "false", "bylineHtml": "<a href=\"profile/guardian-sport\">Guardian sport</a> with Agencies", "showTableOfContents": "false"}, "tags": [{"id": "sport/pga-tour", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "sport", "sectionName": "Sport", "webTitle": "PGA Tour", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/pga-tour", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/pga-tour", "references": []}, {"id": "sport/golf", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "sport", "sectionName": "Sport", "webTitle": "Golf", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/golf", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/golf", "references": []}, {"id": "sport/sport", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "sport", "sectionName": "Sport", "webTitle": "Sport", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport", "references": []}, {"id": "sport/us-sport", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "sport", "sectionName": "Sport", "webTitle": "US sports", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/us-sport", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/us-sport", "references": []}, {"id": "campaign/email/the-recap", "type": "campaign", "webTitle": "The Recap (newsletter signup)", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/campaign/email/the-recap", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/campaign/email/the-recap", "references": [], "campaignInformationType": "email"}, {"id": "type/article", "type": "type", "webTitle": "Article", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/articles", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article", "references": []}, {"id": "tone/news", "type": "tone", "webTitle": "News", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news", "references": []}, {"id": "profile/guardian-sport", "type": "contributor", "webTitle": "Guardian sport", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/guardian-sport", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/guardian-sport", "references": [], "bio": "<p>Guardian sport brings you the latest breaking football and sport news.

History made, but quietly.\nNo team in the 18 years of ALM has ever ended the regular season atop the mountain in back-to-back-to-back years. The feat has only ever been accomplished once before in Australian men\u2019s national league history, when Sydney City won three straight between 1980 and 1982 in the National Soccer League.

Defeated just three times, they are guaranteed to record the fewest defeats in a single season in club history. Their 55 goals scored stands alongside their total from 2021-22 and is just two adrift of the campaign prior.

With Liddell finally shutting on 28 April, business leaders and local officials are hopeful alternative generation projects and manufacturing will eventually fill the site even if few of AGL\u2019s proposed ventures have progressed. \u201cThere was initially a level of \u2018this is going to be a bit of a shock to the system\u2019,\u201d says Danny Eather, president of Business Singleton, which represents about 180 local businesses. \u201cLiddell is really beyond its lifespan as a facility, and I think there\u2019s a general acceptance within the community that this is what had to happen.\u201d Mike Kelly, president of the Muswellbrook Chamber of Commerce and Industry, further up the Hunter Valley, says it\u2019s still unclear what will replace Liddell. \u201cDespite the early notice [of Liddell\u2019s demise], driven by government policy, there is still a lot of uncertainty and cynicism,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t turn off the town water supply to your house if you were planning to put in big tanks next year,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t turn off the grid main supply if you\u2019re planning to put solar panels and wind turbines on your property in the next year or two or five.\u201d Authorities, though, are confident Liddell\u2019s shutdown won\u2019t disrupt the power grid. The Australian Energy Market Operator forecasts the state \u201cwill maintain a reliable power supply\u201d, says Penny Sharpe, the state\u2019s new energy minister. \u201cLiddell is now more than 50 years old. It\u2019s been unreliable for many years, and not operating at its rated capacity,\u201d Sharpe says. \u201cIn 2022, Liddell made around 1,260 megawatts available, a fraction of its 2,000MW rated capacity, and generated only around 7,000 gigawatt-hours across the year.\u201d Vesey\u2019s successor at AGL, Brett Redman, became much more cautious about the rush to invest in new renewables. Plans for a gas-peaker plant near Goulburn and one in the lower Hunter were scrapped altogether, while investments in new batteries and pumped hydro plants at Liddell or nearby have taken longer than expected, insiders say. Management wanted \u201cno additional risk\u201d for coal generation, one of them says. \u201cWhat was happening in the background was that the business was haemorrhaging cash.\u201d Also disrupting AGL\u2019s intentions were interventions in the market by the Turnbull and then Morrison governments, not least Snowy Hydro\u2019s giant Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project and then its Kurri Kurri gas plant in NSW. These threw the whole Generation Plan \u201cout of the window\u201d, they say. Markus Brokhof, AGL\u2019s chief operating officer, is keen to see people move on from that earlier plan. \u201cForget about this, it is history,\u201d he said during a recent visit to Liddell. Brokhof is proud Bayswater has been able to absorb 100 of Liddell\u2019s 140 staff, meaning AGL kept its promise there would be no forced redundancies. The rest will retire or leave the industry. Bayswater\u2019s crew of 460 will swell to 560, with contractors and sub-contractors being cut to make way for the newcomers. AGL aims to make a final investment decision on a 500MW battery for Liddell \u201cprobably in the second half of this year\u201d, Brokhof says. A second battery of the same size may be a future option for a site near the Tomago aluminium smelter, AGL\u2019s biggest customer, also in the Hunter region. A 250MW pumped hydro project about 11km from Liddell that would use a deep coalmine void created by Japan\u2019s Idemitsu Corporation remains at the feasibility study stage. \u201cWe are exploring double that [size],\u201d Brokhof says. Hydrogen production is another option for a post-Liddell future. AGL last year expanded a feasibility study involving Andrew Forrest\u2019s Fortescue Future Industries and other partners to explore development of a green hydrogen and ammonia production facility. Luring other manufacturers to a site well-served with high voltage transmission, roads and railway is another aim of AGL\u2019s. Agriculture may even feature, Brokhof says. A mining engineer by training, Brokhof hails from Dusseldorf, part of the Ruhr region of Germany that has been navigating a transition off mining and heavy industry for decades. \u201cThere are thousands of templates\u201d about how to help communities adjust, he said, while walking near Lake Liddell. \u201cAustralia is not an island. It\u2019s a bit annoying.\u201d Another insider says locals should expect news of a \u201cbig deal\u201d later this year about other companies willing to bring investments. AGL\u2019s Liddell-Bayswater site, bought from the state government for $1.5bn in 2014, covers 10,000 hectares and also about 40% of the high-security water rights in the Hunter. The water licences, linked to the power stations, are among the largest in Australia and roughly equal the total water available to farms and mines in the valley. However, the area\u2019s transition away from fossil fuels may need to speed up, particularly if Bayswater\u2019s closure is brought forward and the mines start to shut. \u201cThe latest is 2033,\u201d Brokhof says, referring to the shutdown timing of the 2,640MW plant. The end of a relatively low-cost coal contract in 2028, however, could challenge Bayswater\u2019s economics before then. A reduced operation, such as retaining just one or more of the four units, may be the result, people familiar with the plant say. Steve Reynolds, mayor of Muswellbrook, worries the community won\u2019t be ready for what is coming. \u201cWe\u2019re in for a turbulent time, there\u2019s no doubt, with the transformation that is going to happen across this region,\u201d Reynolds says. \u201cWe really need that person from the state government, specifically, that\u2019s going to assist us because there\u2019s so many different departments that are siloed under environmental minister, the mining regulator [and so on],\u201d he says. \u201cIf we miss this boat, it will be the generations to come that will pay for their failures.\u201d Michele O\u2019Neil, the Australian Council of Trade Unions president, says a national energy transition authority is required to improve coordination. \u201cThis is something we should have done at least a decade ago and we\u2019ve left many communities without the support needed,\u201d she says. Such a body could help diversify the economy \u201cand create good secure long-term jobs well before closures happen\u201d, O\u2019Neil says. \u201cIt can\u2019t just be left up to the market\u201d.",

The Generation Plan proposed a mix of renewable energy, gas-peaking plants and battery storage, some of which would be on or near Liddell\u2019s site in the New South Wales Hunter Valley. Its sister coal-fired power station, Bayswater, would also get an upgrade. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nAGL\u2019s then chief executive, Andy Vesey, estimated the capital investment would total almost $1.4bn, with the new assets operating for as long as 30 years. By contrast, extending Liddell\u2019s life beyond its planned 2022 closure would cost $920m and only add five years to a plant then almost 50 years old. As events transpired, the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and Vesey both got rolled on the same day, 24 August 2018. \u201cThey lost their PM over energy and we lost a CEO,\u201d one AGL insider says. With Liddell finally shutting on 28 April, business leaders and local officials are hopeful alternative generation projects and manufacturing will eventually fill the site even if few of AGL\u2019s proposed ventures have progressed. \u201cThere was initially a level of \u2018this is going to be a bit of a shock to the system\u2019,\u201d says Danny Eather, president of Business Singleton, which represents about 180 local businesses. \u201cLiddell is really beyond its lifespan as a facility, and I think there\u2019s a general acceptance within the community that this is what had to happen.\u201d Mike Kelly, president of the Muswellbrook Chamber of Commerce and Industry, further up the Hunter Valley, says it\u2019s still unclear what will replace Liddell. \u201cDespite the early notice [of Liddell\u2019s demise], driven by government policy, there is still a lot of uncertainty and cynicism,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t turn off the town water supply to your house if you were planning to put in big tanks next year,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t turn off the grid main supply if you\u2019re planning to put solar panels and wind turbines on your property in the next year or two or five.\u201d Authorities, though, are confident Liddell\u2019s shutdown won\u2019t disrupt the power grid. The Australian Energy Market Operator forecasts the state \u201cwill maintain a reliable power supply\u201d, says Penny Sharpe, the state\u2019s new energy minister. \u201cLiddell is now more than 50 years old. It\u2019s been unreliable for many years, and not operating at its rated capacity,\u201d Sharpe says. \u201cIn 2022, Liddell made around 1,260 megawatts available, a fraction of its 2,000MW rated capacity, and generated only around 7,000 gigawatt-hours across the year.\u201d Vesey\u2019s successor at AGL, Brett Redman, became much more cautious about the rush to invest in new renewables. Plans for a gas-peaker plant near Goulburn and one in the lower Hunter were scrapped altogether, while investments in new batteries and pumped hydro plants at Liddell or nearby have taken longer than expected, insiders say.\nManagement wanted \u201cno additional risk\u201d for coal generation, one of them says. \u201cWhat was happening in the background was that the business was haemorrhaging cash.\u201d Also disrupting AGL\u2019s intentions were interventions in the market by the Turnbull and then Morrison governments, not least Snowy Hydro\u2019s giant Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project and then its Kurri Kurri gas plant in NSW. These threw the whole Generation Plan \u201cout of the window\u201d, they say. Markus Brokhof, AGL\u2019s chief operating officer, is keen to see people move on from that earlier plan. \u201cForget about this, it is history,\u201d he said during a recent visit to Liddell.\nBrokhof is proud Bayswater has been able to absorb 100 of Liddell\u2019s 140 staff, meaning AGL kept its promise there would be no forced redundancies. The rest will retire or leave the industry. Bayswater\u2019s crew of 460 will swell to 560, with contractors and sub-contractors being cut to make way for the newcomers. AGL aims to make a final investment decision on a 500MW battery for Liddell \u201cprobably in the second half of this year\u201d, Brokhof says. A second battery of the same size may be a future option for a site near the Tomago aluminium smelter, AGL\u2019s biggest customer, also in the Hunter region. A 250MW pumped hydro project about 11km from Liddell that would use a deep coalmine void created by Japan\u2019s Idemitsu Corporation remains at the feasibility study stage. \u201cWe are exploring double that [size],\u201d Brokhof says. Hydrogen production is another option for a post-Liddell future. AGL last year expanded a feasibility study involving Andrew Forrest\u2019s Fortescue Future Industries and other partners to explore development of a green hydrogen and ammonia production facility.\nLuring other manufacturers to a site well-served with high voltage transmission, roads and railway is another aim of AGL\u2019s. Agriculture may even feature, Brokhof says. A mining engineer by training, Brokhof hails from Dusseldorf, part of the Ruhr region of Germany that has been navigating a transition off mining and heavy industry for decades. \u201cThere are thousands of templates\u201d about how to help communities adjust, he said, while walking near Lake Liddell. \u201cAustralia is not an island. It\u2019s a bit annoying.\u201d Another insider says locals should expect news of a \u201cbig deal\u201d later this year about other companies willing to bring investments. AGL\u2019s Liddell-Bayswater site, bought from the state government for $1.5bn in 2014, covers 10,000 hectares and also about 40% of the high-security water rights in the Hunter. The water licences, linked to the power stations, are among the largest in Australia and roughly equal the total water available to farms and mines in the valley. However, the area\u2019s transition away from fossil fuels may need to speed up, particularly if Bayswater\u2019s closure is brought forward and the mines start to shut. \u201cThe latest is 2033,\u201d Brokhof says, referring to the shutdown timing of the 2,640MW plant. The end of a relatively low-cost coal contract in 2028, however, could challenge Bayswater\u2019s economics before then. A reduced operation, such as retaining just one or more of the four units, may be the result, people familiar with the plant say.\nSteve Reynolds, mayor of Muswellbrook, worries the community won\u2019t be ready for what is coming. \u201cWe\u2019re in for a turbulent time, there\u2019s no doubt, with the transformation that is going to happen across this region,\u201d Reynolds says. \u201cWe really need that person from the state government, specifically, that\u2019s going to assist us because there\u2019s so many different departments that are siloed under environmental minister, the mining regulator [and so on],\u201d he says. \u201cIf we miss this boat, it will be the generations to come that will pay for their failures.\u201d Michele O\u2019Neil, the Australian Council of Trade Unions president, says a national energy transition authority is required to improve coordination. \u201cThis is something we should have done at least a decade ago and we\u2019ve left many communities without the support needed,\u201d she says. Such a body could help diversify the economy \u201cand create good secure long-term jobs well before closures happen\u201d, O\u2019Neil says. \u201cIt can\u2019t just be left up to the market\u201d.", "attributes": {}, "published": true, "createdDate": "2023-04-17T01:00:25Z", "firstPublishedDate": "2023-04-17T01:00:25Z", "publishedDate": "2023-04-17T03:19:25Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-04-17T03:19:25Z", "contributors": [], "elements": [{"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>When AGL Energy was in a tangle with the Turnbull government over the future of its Liddell power station in 2017<a href=\"https://www.agl.com.au/about-agl/media-centre/asx-and-media-releases/2017/december/agl-announces-plans-for-liddell-power-station#:~:text=The%20NSW%20Generation%20Plan%20proposes,at%20Liddell%20into%20synchronous%20condensers.\">, it drew up an extensive scheme</a> listing how it would replace the coal-fired plant with equivalent generation capacity.</p> \n<p>The Generation Plan proposed a mix of renewable energy, gas-peaking plants and battery storage, some of which would be on or near Liddell\u2019s site in the New South Wales Hunter Valley.

The Magpies were allowed to play their own way for the first three weeks. But you don\u2019t get that free rein for long. In this competition, there\u2019s always a Ross Lyon waiting with a baseball bat. And for all the talk of a new Ross, a cuddlier Ross, a more attacking Ross, some things never change. This is a man who once said \u201cit\u2019s easier to destruct than to create\u201d. Indeed, St Kilda\u2019s opening month was one of the most miserly in the history of the game, conceding just 56 goals. And so, unsurprisingly, one of the most attacking teams in the game was constantly thwarted and frustrated. They were denied the corridor. Their high balls were picked off by St Kilda\u2019s tall defenders. They had injuries and illnesses. They had to win ugly. They had an inordinate number of smothers. And they had Nick Daicos. There\u2019s a school of thought that Daicos is \u2018stat padding\u2019, that he gets too many cheap kicks, and that he doesn\u2019t win his own ball. It\u2019s a peculiar hill to die on. True, he just zips about \u2013 smooth, smart, neat. But he had 42 possessions yesterday. He\u2019s pretty handy, as Lyon would say. Whenever Daicos has the ball, the possibilities up the field open up. The forwards can lead to spots they\u2019d otherwise never venture. They know he\u2019ll find them. Jason Dunstall used to say that about leading to Darren Jarman. He was never more confident on a football field as when Jarman had the ball and was loping in his direction. Nick Daicos isn\u2019t as good a kick as Darren Jarman. No one is. But he almost never misses. He\u2019s now the Brownlow Medal favourite. He\u2019s also 20 years old. Another 20-year-old made a welcome return yesterday. I felt a bit for Jack Ginnivan in recent months. When his drug scandal broke, Channel 7 seemed to have assigned three dozen reporters to the story. They all addressed the camera like it was a giant pork chop. Jack is a smart footballer. But off the field, the frontal cortex is still forming. A cursory survey of young men at the Torquay Hotel in the middle of summer is not going to showcase a gender and a generation at the top of its game. In the end, it was 24-hours of \u2018value swaps\u2019, a little bit of tut-tutting but mainly shoulder shrugging from a generation disinclined to let a Channel 7 journalist or a footy club play moral arbiter. Ginnivan looked a bit subdued yesterday, but still did some clever things, kicking a clutch goal early in the final term and forcing a key turnover. And he reminded us, as Ken Hinkley did on Saturday night when he defended Jason Horne-Francis, that we\u2019re pitiless on our young players. \u201cSome people who put pressure on kids in this game need to take a good hard look at themselves,\u201d he said. Indeed, there\u2019s a cottage industry of former footballers, newshounds and anonymous trolls who delight in tearing these kids to shreds. But with apologies to the South Australian Premier, it was the kids who owned Gather Round.
