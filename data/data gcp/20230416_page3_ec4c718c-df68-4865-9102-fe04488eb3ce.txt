In the past week alone, there has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/11/row-between-twitter-and-substack-ends-with-uneasy-truce\">a spat</a> with Substack, further problems with the site\u2019s infrastructure and NPR, the US radio network, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/12/npr-leaves-twitter-elon-musk-state-media\">quit the platform</a>. Musk himself admitted in an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65248196\">interview</a> with the BBC that running Twitter had been \u201cpainful\u201d and that buying it had come with \u201cemotional strain\u201d.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a look at how key areas of Twitter\u2019s business have performed.</p> <h2>Debt and company value</h2> <p>The end of the month does not just mark six months since Musk\u2019s purchase, it is also the due date for the second quarterly instalment on paying down Twitter\u2019s $13bn debt burden (a payment of about $300m).</p> <p>When the first payment approached in January, it was against a backdrop of doom-laden warnings from Musk, who had cautioned shortly after the takeover that \u201cbankruptcy isn\u2019t out of the question\u201d.</p> <p>True, Musk had paid $44bn for a business that had been largely loss-making since its launch in 2006. But his own decisions at the platform had led to an advertiser boycott that had caused significant damage to the platform\u2019s main source of revenue (more than $5bn in 2021).</p> <p>Last month it emerged that Twitter is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/26/elon-musk-twitter-value-leaked-memo-less-than-half-paid\">worth less than half</a> of what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk\">Musk</a> paid for it, having lost more than $20bn (\u00a316.4bn) in value, according to calculations based on a leaked memo.</p> <h2>Financial performance</h2> <p>Once at the helm, Musk slashed costs and, last month, the CEO said he thought Twitter had a chance of <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/musk-twitter-has-a-shot-at-becoming-cash-flow-positive-in-second-quarter?rc=fnnefa\">turning cashflow positive</a> \u2013 broadly, spending less cash to run the business than it takes in \u2013 in the current quarter. He repeated the claim in the BBC interview. In March he told a Morgan Stanley conference in San Francisco that Twitter\u2019s revenue was due to drop to less than $3bn this year but expenditure had dropped from $4.5bn to $1.5bn.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Musk, as is his wont, has been a chaos agent, unfocused and unpredictable \u2026</p> <footer> <cite>Aswath Damodaran</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, says Musk\u2019s high-risk approach could pay off for a platform that was struggling for financial stability even before the chaotic takeover.</p> <p>\u201cTwitter has always been a basket case as a business, unable to monetize its users into advertising revenues and the status quo was getting them nowhere,\u201d he says. \u201cMusk, as is his wont, has been a chaos agent, unfocused and unpredictable, but I would think that Twitter stands a chance of making it out of the forest, precisely because of this chaos.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, Musk recently folded Twitter into an entity called X Corp.

Nearly six months later, it became a dog. The distinctive avian logo the Tesla CEO had referenced in October had been replaced by a picture of a Shiba Inu canine \u2013 the face of the Dogecoin cryptocurrency. There was speculation over what was behind the change. Was it linked to a recent attempt to dismiss a $258bn lawsuit filed against Musk by Dogecoin investors over an alleged pyramid scheme? Was it a delayed April Fool\u2019s gag? Whatever the reason, the dog has now gone. But the episode was exemplary of Musk\u2019s decision-making style at the social media company: erratic, and sometimes, inscrutable in motivation. As we approach six months of Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter, it remains far from business as usual at the company. In the past week alone, there has been a spat with Substack, further problems with the site\u2019s infrastructure and NPR, the US radio network, has quit the platform. Musk himself admitted in an interview with the BBC that running Twitter had been \u201cpainful\u201d and that buying it had come with \u201cemotional strain\u201d. Here\u2019s a look at how key areas of Twitter\u2019s business have performed. Debt and company value The end of the month does not just mark six months since Musk\u2019s purchase, it is also the due date for the second quarterly instalment on paying down Twitter\u2019s $13bn debt burden (a payment of about $300m). When the first payment approached in January, it was against a backdrop of doom-laden warnings from Musk, who had cautioned shortly after the takeover that \u201cbankruptcy isn\u2019t out of the question\u201d. True, Musk had paid $44bn for a business that had been largely loss-making since its launch in 2006. But his own decisions at the platform had led to an advertiser boycott that had caused significant damage to the platform\u2019s main source of revenue (more than $5bn in 2021). Last month it emerged that Twitter is now worth less than half of what Musk paid for it, having lost more than $20bn (\u00a316.4bn) in value, according to calculations based on a leaked memo. Financial performance Once at the helm, Musk slashed costs and, last month, the CEO said he thought Twitter had a chance of turning cashflow positive \u2013 broadly, spending less cash to run the business than it takes in \u2013 in the current quarter. He repeated the claim in the BBC interview. In March he told a Morgan Stanley conference in San Francisco that Twitter\u2019s revenue was due to drop to less than $3bn this year but expenditure had dropped from $4.5bn to $1.5bn. Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, says Musk\u2019s high-risk approach could pay off for a platform that was struggling for financial stability even before the chaotic takeover. \u201cTwitter has always been a basket case as a business, unable to monetize its users into advertising revenues and the status quo was getting them nowhere,\u201d he says. \u201cMusk, as is his wont, has been a chaos agent, unfocused and unpredictable, but I would think that Twitter stands a chance of making it out of the forest, precisely because of this chaos.\u201d Indeed, Musk recently folded Twitter into an entity called X Corp. Musk has referred to Twitter as being an \u201caccelerant\u201d for creating X, his \u201ceverything app\u201d akin to WeChat in China. User base A self-declared\u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d, Musk early on chose to reinstate accounts that had been banned under the platform\u2019s previous owners. Those included the accounts for Donald Trump, misogynist influencer Andrew Tate and the personal account of the far-right US congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. According to Musk, users have not fled the platform in response. Musk said in November that Twitter\u2019s user numbers had crossed 250 million, up from 238 million before the takeover. The controversy around account reinstatement, the threat of losing blue-check status and Musk\u2019s dislike of mainstream media, including banning some prominent reporters, also do not seem to have deterred the journalists and influential pundits who use the platform regularly (see the Gary Lineker tweet that drove a whole news cycle recently). \u201cDespite all the talk that journalists would be leaving Twitter, in practice very few have done so because it remains an important part of workflows, with networks that have been built up and carefully curated over the years \u2013 as well as being a compelling and amusing distraction,\u201d says Nic Newman, a senior research associate at the Reuters Institute for the Study Journalism. \u201cOur data suggests that there has been no substantial drop-off in the number of people that use it weekly \u2013 though that may well come.\u201d Staff In an effort to dramatically cut costs, Musk axed half of the company\u2019s 7,500-strong workforce within days of sealing the takeover and reduced it further through a series of cuts including a bizarre redundancy program where staff were asked to commit to being \u201chardcore\u201d or leave.

Nearly six months later, it became a dog. The distinctive avian logo the Tesla CEO had referenced in October had been replaced by a picture of a Shiba Inu canine \u2013 the face of the Dogecoin cryptocurrency.\nThere was speculation over what was behind the change. Was it linked to a recent attempt to dismiss a $258bn lawsuit filed against Musk by Dogecoin investors over an alleged pyramid scheme? Was it a delayed April Fool\u2019s gag? Whatever the reason, the dog has now gone. But the episode was exemplary of Musk\u2019s decision-making style at the social media company: erratic, and sometimes, inscrutable in motivation. As we approach six months of Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter, it remains far from business as usual at the company. In the past week alone, there has been a spat with Substack, further problems with the site\u2019s infrastructure and NPR, the US radio network, has quit the platform. Musk himself admitted in an interview with the BBC that running Twitter had been \u201cpainful\u201d and that buying it had come with \u201cemotional strain\u201d. Here\u2019s a look at how key areas of Twitter\u2019s business have performed. Debt and company value The end of the month does not just mark six months since Musk\u2019s purchase, it is also the due date for the second quarterly instalment on paying down Twitter\u2019s $13bn debt burden (a payment of about $300m). When the first payment approached in January, it was against a backdrop of doom-laden warnings from Musk, who had cautioned shortly after the takeover that \u201cbankruptcy isn\u2019t out of the question\u201d. True, Musk had paid $44bn for a business that had been largely loss-making since its launch in 2006. But his own decisions at the platform had led to an advertiser boycott that had caused significant damage to the platform\u2019s main source of revenue (more than $5bn in 2021). Last month it emerged that Twitter is now worth less than half of what Musk paid for it, having lost more than $20bn (\u00a316.4bn) in value, according to calculations based on a leaked memo. Financial performance Once at the helm, Musk slashed costs and, last month, the CEO said he thought Twitter had a chance of turning cashflow positive \u2013 broadly, spending less cash to run the business than it takes in \u2013 in the current quarter. He repeated the claim in the BBC interview. In March he told a Morgan Stanley conference in San Francisco that Twitter\u2019s revenue was due to drop to less than $3bn this year but expenditure had dropped from $4.5bn to $1.5bn.\nAswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, says Musk\u2019s high-risk approach could pay off for a platform that was struggling for financial stability even before the chaotic takeover. \u201cTwitter has always been a basket case as a business, unable to monetize its users into advertising revenues and the status quo was getting them nowhere,\u201d he says. \u201cMusk, as is his wont, has been a chaos agent, unfocused and unpredictable, but I would think that Twitter stands a chance of making it out of the forest, precisely because of this chaos.\u201d Indeed, Musk recently folded Twitter into an entity called X Corp.

Musk said in November that Twitter\u2019s user numbers had crossed 250 million, up from 238 million before the takeover.</p> \n<p>The controversy around account reinstatement, the threat of losing blue-check status and Musk\u2019s dislike of mainstream media, including banning some prominent reporters, also do not seem to have deterred the journalists and influential pundits who use the platform regularly (see the Gary Lineker tweet that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/mar/11/assault-on-free-speech-gary-linekers-defenders-and-detractors\">drove a whole news cycle</a> recently).</p>"}}, {"type": "image", "assets": [{"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f065ba430b6111db11b1b815606fe5bd5c7380de/167_0_2833_1700/2833.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 2833, "height": 1700}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f065ba430b6111db11b1b815606fe5bd5c7380de/167_0_2833_1700/master/2833.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 2833, "height": 1700, "isMaster": true}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f065ba430b6111db11b1b815606fe5bd5c7380de/167_0_2833_1700/2000.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 2000, "height": 1200}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f065ba430b6111db11b1b815606fe5bd5c7380de/167_0_2833_1700/1000.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 1000, "height": 600}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f065ba430b6111db11b1b815606fe5bd5c7380de/167_0_2833_1700/500.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 500, "height": 300}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f065ba430b6111db11b1b815606fe5bd5c7380de/167_0_2833_1700/140.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 140, "height": 84}}], "imageTypeData": {"caption": "Elon Musk carrying a sink in to the Twitter HQ on 26 October 2022.", "displayCredit": true, "credit": "Photograph: Twitter account of Elon Musk/AFP/Getty Images", "source": "Twitter account of Elon Musk/AFP/Getty Images", "alt": "Elon Musk carrying a sink in to the Twitter HQ on 26 October 2022.", "mediaId": "f065ba430b6111db11b1b815606fe5bd5c7380de", "mediaApiUri": "https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/f065ba430b6111db11b1b815606fe5bd5c7380de", "suppliersReference": "AFP_32M96A2.jpg", "imageType": "Photograph"}}, {"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>\u201cDespite all the talk that journalists would be leaving Twitter, in practice very few have done so because it remains an important part of workflows, with networks that have been built up and carefully curated over the years \u2013 as well as being a compelling and amusing distraction,\u201d says Nic Newman, a senior research associate at the Reuters Institute for the Study Journalism.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur data suggests that there has been no substantial drop-off in the number of people that use it weekly \u2013 though that may well come.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Staff</h2> \n<p>In an effort to dramatically cut costs, Musk axed half of the company\u2019s 7,500-strong workforce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/04/twitter-layoffs-elon-musk-revenue-drop\">within days of sealing the takeover</a> and reduced it further through a series of cuts including a bizarre redundancy program where staff were asked to commit to being \u201chardcore\u201d or leave. Such was the chaotic reaction to that ultimatum, Twitter was forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/17/elon-musk-twitter-closes-offices-loyalty-oath-resignations\">shut offices temporarily</a>.</p> \n<p>According to one former employee who was made redundant following the takeover, the platform has gone backwards. \u201cFor many of us former tweeps, seeing what Musk is doing to Twitter is heartbreaking,\u201d said the former staff member, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cThe platform has regressed in terms of toxicity, safety and nuance. The hard work of dedicated teams and colleagues over the years has been erased, including efforts to combat misinformation and create trustworthy safety policies and curation standards.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Advertisers</h2> \n<p>Concerns over Musk\u2019s erratic decision making, approach to content moderation and a botched relaunch of Twitter\u2019s Blue subscription service underlined Musk\u2019s revenue projections last month. At one point in January, the company\u2019s daily revenue was down 40% year-over-year, according to the tech newsletter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1615519936805482496\">the Platformer</a> and some boycotts remain in place. Pharmaceutical firms Eli Lilly and Pfizer, retailer Macy\u2019s and Cadbury owner Mond\u0113lez spent no money on Twitter in the first two months of the year, according to the advertising data firm MediaRadar. However, MediaRadar said there were 3,700 companies advertising on Twitter in February \u2013 8% more than the same period last year (although some, like Volkswagen, General Motors and Chipotle, have reduced their spending significantly).</p>"}}, {"type": "pullquote", "assets": [], "pullquoteTypeData": {"html": "The platform has regressed in terms of toxicity, safety and nuance.

The first relaunch of Twitter Blue, in November, was paused after it led to a slew of fake \u201cverified\u201d accounts.</p> \n<p>The company tried again in December, offering subscribers perks such as a blue tick \u2013 giving your account more prominence on the For You feed \u2013 and fewer adverts for $8 a month on the web or $11 on iOS or Android.</p> \n<p>According to Travis Brown, a software developer who has been tracking Twitter\u2019s subscription service, the new-look Blue has about 550-585,000 subscribers which equates to $4m+ a month in revenue. Twitter will need many more sign-ups to offset the advertising loss.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the 400,000 legacy blue checks face a loss of status. Musk told the BBC that these checks will be phased out by next week, although a deadline has been missed before.</p> \n<h2>Site performance and regulators</h2> \n<p>Twitter has been hit by a series of outages since it was bought. In the latest breach, users reported that Twitter\u2019s privacy-friendly Circles feature was leaking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/11/row-between-twitter-and-substack-ends-with-uneasy-truce\">private user data</a>.</p> \n<p>The US Federal Trade Commission is investigating the company amid concerns that Twitter\u2019s ability to protect users, and comply with a <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2022/05/twitter-pay-150-million-penalty-allegedly-breaking-its-privacy-promises-again\">2022 deal</a> with the FTC to maintain high data security standards, might have been affected by redundancies and cost cuts.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe FTC\u2019s investigation is quite serious,\u201d says David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. \u201cThere is deep concern within the FTC as to whether Twitter is, in fact, making a concerted effort to bring it into compliance with the May 2022 consent decree.\u201d</p> \n<p>Vladeck says that unless Twitter \u201cups its game\u201d another enforcement action, including \u201csubstantial civil penalties\u201d, looms.</p> \n<p>An emailed request for comment sent to Twitter\u2019s press office was met, as is now standard practice at the company, with a poop emoji.</p>"}}]}], "totalBodyBlocks": 1}, "rights": {"syndicatable": "true", "subscriptionDatabases": "true", "developerCommunity": "true"}, "section": {"id": "technology", "webTitle": "Technology", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/technology", "editions": [{"id": "technology", "webTitle": "Technology", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/technology", "code": "default"}, {"id": "au/technology", "webTitle": "Technology", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/au/technology", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/au/technology", "code": "au"}, {"id": "uk/technology", "webTitle": "Technology", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/technology", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/technology", "code": "uk"}, {"id": "us/technology", "webTitle": "Technology", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us/technology", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/us/technology", "code": "us"}]}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "lifeandstyle/2023/apr/16/is-it-fair-to-put-my-abusive-elderly-father-into-a-home-ask-philippa-perry", "type": "article", "sectionId": "lifeandstyle", "sectionName": "Life and style", "webPublicationDate": "2023-04-16T05:00:03Z", "webTitle": "Is it fair to put my abusive, elderly father into a home? | Ask Philippa", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/16/is-it-fair-to-put-my-abusive-elderly-father-into-a-home-ask-philippa-perry", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/16/is-it-fair-to-put-my-abusive-elderly-father-into-a-home-ask-philippa-perry", "fields": {"headline": "Is it fair to put my abusive, elderly father into a home?", "standfirst": "A home is the best place for him now \u2013 and it\u2019s time to talk to friends or a therapist so you can hear and have compassion for yourself without fearing your father", "trailText": "A home is the best place for him now, Says Philippa Perry.

Mostly these emails contain just the name of a restaurant from one side and a reply with the single word \u201cyours\u201d from the other.</p> <p>When I emailed to say I was planning to review <a href=\"https://thekolossi.com/menu\" title=\"\">the Kolossi grill</a> on Rosebery Avenue in London\u2019s Clerkenwell, my famously lugubrious colleague\u2019s response was the word \u201cblimey\u201d followed by a sentence questioning the sanity of everyone involved. I understood why. The Kolossi first opened in 1966, a short stumble from what in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/2002/jun/11/1\" title=\"\">1976</a> became the <em>Guardian</em> and later the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s home, until 2008. It has a kitsch Palladian frontage, as if it were a Poundland offshoot of the Acropolis. It would be unfair to say it was actively bad. It was part of a generation of mostly Greek Cypriot restaurants scattered across the UK that offered a narrow, reliably robust version of the Greek repertoire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f34c97a28544fbc33d5f4b64160026b47f6121b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f34c97a28544fbc33d5f4b64160026b47f6121b4/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Whipped and frothy\u2019: tarama and pitta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Whipped and frothy\u2019: tarama and pitta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the newspapers\u2019 staff, however, the Kolossi\u2019s greatest virtue was simply that it was there. You went there after the pub, guided by instinct. With the searing wit of headline writers everywhere, it was nicknamed the Colossal Bill, perhaps in celebration of its cheapness. Or it was called something else, which was hilariously funny in 1992 and really isn\u2019t now. Back then the walls were panelled in orange-varnished wood. There was plastic ivy dangling from the beamed ceiling and, on occasion, a belly dancer. A paid one, not a subeditor who had got carried away, two bottles of caustic retsina to the bad. Although that might have happened. It could all get very messy. The lovely staff were forgiving.</p> <p>So no, not an obvious candidate for the once over. But then I learned that the owners these past 34 years had moved on. The lease had been taken over by a businessman named David Lonsdale, who is involved with the nearby <a href=\"https://www.thesekforde.com/\" title=\"\">Sekforde</a>. He had restored that Georgian pub to its former glory. Now he was doing the same with the Kolossi. I checked out the menu, which used to be long. It is now short and to the point and rather attractive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb1c5b395b922cb60ad53078c40e5f3820655c73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb1c5b395b922cb60ad53078c40e5f3820655c73/0_117_5172_3102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Baked with olive oil, feta, oregano and the sweetest of cherry tomatoes\u2019: prawns saganaki.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Baked with olive oil, feta, oregano and the sweetest of cherry tomatoes\u2019: prawns saganaki.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So here I am once more, clambering out of a cab at the scene of so many lost nights. The faux Palladian fa\u00e7ade is still in place, but it has been repainted from a light olive green to a deep Aegean blue. And hang on. What\u2019s this? The name seems to have changed. It is now called Attica, presumably after the Greek peninsula. Although at the time of writing it\u2019s still called the Kolossi on its website and elsewhere online. We\u2019re modern. We can handle this two names thing. Inside, the wood panelling has been stripped and repainted in shades of cream. The plastic ivy on the ceiling has been replaced by a fairy-lit canopy of twigs. The paper tablecloths have gone. It\u2019s now all solid marble.</p> <p>But it\u2019s still that room. It\u2019s still that place where I remember putting the world to rights and filling up my glass again mid-anecdote, even though I knew I\u2019d pay for it the next morning, and then filling the glass once more. I can still hear the echoes of when it operated as an unofficial club room for a bunch of people with a shared endeavour. In those spaces the quality of the cooking matters far less than the fact that you have all chosen to sit in it together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4aa518dfa1153453470551c370b96d05da75f78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4aa518dfa1153453470551c370b96d05da75f78/0_137_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Served on a bed of nutty new potatoes with its own lemon-boosted sauce\u2019: seabass.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Served on a bed of nutty new potatoes with its own lemon-boosted sauce\u2019: seabass.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then the food started to arrive and I knew we were somewhere else entirely. Once upon a time restaurants like the original Kolossi were the only place you\u2019d find tarama and it would be bright pink and grainy and acidic. Now it\u2019s become a part of menus in so many other ambitious restaurants, as a mark of good taste. The bar has been raised. This version, from the short list of dips with which the menu opens, is a match for any of them. It\u2019s whipped and frothy and comes dressed with a shiny puddle of olive oil, lots of chopped dill and a single salty kalamata olive. The accompanying pitta is warm and soft and oil-slicked. There are deep-fried zucchini balls, creamy inside and crisp outside, with a coarse and garlicky tzatziki.

A skewer of lamb souvlaki brings salty, charred meat that has clearly been grilled at speed to save it from being ruined, with a rugged salad and a dish of a lemony tahini dressing. A fat fillet of seabass, its skin crisped, slouches louchely on a bed of nutty new potatoes with its own lemon-boosted sauce. Only a Cretan salad, made with hefty chunks of barley rusk, is a little heavy-going. It may well be exactly as it\u2019s meant to be. In which case what it\u2019s meant to be turns out to be a little heavy-going.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"034ebca89b62c5279ace7c0737382c517f714e43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/034ebca89b62c5279ace7c0737382c517f714e43/0_193_5158_3094/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Soft, fragrant\u2019: orange cake and mastic ice-cream.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Soft, fragrant\u2019: orange cake and mastic ice-cream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is not cooking that redefines the very notion of Greek food. It\u2019s not revelatory. It\u2019s so much better than that. It\u2019s the essentials done with due care and attention. Service is run by one lovely bearded man from Athens, who doesn\u2019t miss a beat and seems delighted to see his customers enjoying themselves. In the half-open kitchen, there\u2019s one older chap, grilling the meats and dribbling the olive oil in all the right places. Desserts are syrup-drenched pastries with a scoop of mastic ice-cream, with that slightly bouncy, rubbery texture, familiar to anyone who has ever bought a cornet in the hottest of climes. We have a slab of soft, fragrant orange cake and another made with walnuts. The short, entirely Greek wine list, currently boasting just one retsina, helps it all on its way. The Kolossi Grill AKA Attica grill is that rare thing; a venerable restaurant that has found a way to avoid decline and start afresh. I used to know you very well, old friend. I look forward to getting to know you all over again.</p> <h2><strong>News bites</strong></h2> <p>Two restaurants, both very much enjoyed by this column, have announced they are closing, and both attribute the decision to rising costs and generally appalling trading conditions. In Worthing, <em>MasterChef</em> winner Kenny Tutt closes Bayside Social today, but will continue to focus on <a href=\"https://www.pitchrestaurant.co.uk/\">Pitch</a>, his other restaurant in the town. Meanwhile in Ramsbottom, Levanter Fine Foods has now closed. However, its sister restaurant, the Basque-influenced Baratxuri, which recently relocated to Manchester city centre, is very much alive and well (<a href=\"http://baratxuri.co.uk/\">baratxuri.co.uk</a>).</p> <p>There\u2019s money in pizza. Fulham Shore, the company that operates the Franco Manca chain as well as the Real Greek group, looks set to accept a cash takeover offer from a Japanese restaurant business called Toridoll Holdings. The offer values Fulham Shore at just shy of \u00a395m and would benefit chairman and co-founder David Page to the tune of \u00a311m. Franco Manca, which started with one site in Brixton market in 2008, now has just over 70 outlets across the UK (<a href=\"http://francomanca.co.uk/\">francomanca.co.uk</a>).</p> <p>We started with news of closures so let\u2019s finish with news of an opening. Josh and Victoria Overington, who closed their York restaurant Le Cochon Aveugle late last year, have announced the opening in June of My\u0301se, which is pronounced meez and comes from the Anglo Saxon for \u201ceating at the table\u201d. It\u2019s a restaurant with rooms in the North Yorkshire village of Hovingham and as with so many ambitious new openings at the moment, will offer an evening tasting menu. It will cost \u00a3110 a head and will include a duck liver and walnut pie, baked scallop with sea urchin, and goats milk ice-cream with caramelised honey and raspberry juice.</p> <p><em>Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrayner1?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@jayrayner1</a></em></p>", "newspaperPageNumber": "26", "wordcount": "1391", "commentCloseDate": "2023-04-16T20:45:00Z", "commentable": "true", "firstPublicationDate": "2023-04-16T05:00:02Z", "isInappropriateForSponsorship": "false", "isPremoderated": "false", "lastModified": "2023-04-16T20:29:27Z", "newspaperEditionDate": "2023-04-16T00:00:00Z", "productionOffice": "UK", "publication": "The Observer", "shortUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/p/nmac8", "shouldHideAdverts": "false", "showInRelatedContent": "true", "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d56bef5f6dd4c447f945c35f71b184a77ed839fa/0_270_5523_3314/500.jpg", "legallySensitive": "false", "lang": "en", "isLive": "true", "bodyText": "The Kolossi/Attica, 50-60 Rosebery Avenue, London EC1R 4RR.

Once upon a time restaurants like the original Kolossi were the only place you\u2019d find tarama and it would be bright pink and grainy and acidic. Now it\u2019s become a part of menus in so many other ambitious restaurants, as a mark of good taste. The bar has been raised. This version, from the short list of dips with which the menu opens, is a match for any of them.

A fat fillet of seabass, its skin crisped, slouches louchely on a bed of nutty new potatoes with its own lemon-boosted sauce.

It\u2019s not revelatory. It\u2019s so much better than that. It\u2019s the essentials done with due care and attention. Service is run by one lovely bearded man from Athens, who doesn\u2019t miss a beat and seems delighted to see his customers enjoying themselves. In the half-open kitchen, there\u2019s one older chap, grilling the meats and dribbling the olive oil in all the right places. Desserts are syrup-drenched pastries with a scoop of mastic ice-cream, with that slightly bouncy, rubbery texture, familiar to anyone who has ever bought a cornet in the hottest of climes. We have a slab of soft, fragrant orange cake and another made with walnuts. The short, entirely Greek wine list, currently boasting just one retsina, helps it all on its way. The Kolossi Grill AKA Attica grill is that rare thing; a venerable restaurant that has found a way to avoid decline and start afresh. I used to know you very well, old friend. I look forward to getting to know you all over again.</p> <h2><strong>News bites</strong></h2> <p>Two restaurants, both very much enjoyed by this column, have announced they are closing, and both attribute the decision to rising costs and generally appalling trading conditions. In Worthing, <em>MasterChef</em> winner Kenny Tutt closes Bayside Social today, but will continue to focus on <a href=\"https://www.pitchrestaurant.co.uk/\">Pitch</a>, his other restaurant in the town. Meanwhile in Ramsbottom, Levanter Fine Foods has now closed. However, its sister restaurant, the Basque-influenced Baratxuri, which recently relocated to Manchester city centre, is very much alive and well (<a href=\"http://baratxuri.co.uk/\">baratxuri.co.uk</a>).</p> <p>There\u2019s money in pizza. Fulham Shore, the company that operates the Franco Manca chain as well as the Real Greek group, looks set to accept a cash takeover offer from a Japanese restaurant business called Toridoll Holdings. The offer values Fulham Shore at just shy of \u00a395m and would benefit chairman and co-founder David Page to the tune of \u00a311m. Franco Manca, which started with one site in Brixton market in 2008, now has just over 70 outlets across the UK (<a href=\"http://francomanca.co.uk/\">francomanca.co.uk</a>).</p> <p>We started with news of closures so let\u2019s finish with news of an opening. Josh and Victoria Overington, who closed their York restaurant Le Cochon Aveugle late last year, have announced the opening in June of My\u0301se, which is pronounced meez and comes from the Anglo Saxon for \u201ceating at the table\u201d. It\u2019s a restaurant with rooms in the North Yorkshire village of Hovingham and as with so many ambitious new openings at the moment, will offer an evening tasting menu. It will cost \u00a3110 a head and will include a duck liver and walnut pie, baked scallop with sea urchin, and goats milk ice-cream with caramelised honey and raspberry juice.</p> <p><em>Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrayner1?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@jayrayner1</a></em></p>", "bodyTextSummary": "The Kolossi/Attica, 50-60 Rosebery Avenue, London EC1R 4RR.

News bites Two restaurants, both very much enjoyed by this column, have announced they are closing, and both attribute the decision to rising costs and generally appalling trading conditions. In Worthing, MasterChef winner Kenny Tutt closes Bayside Social today, but will continue to focus on Pitch, his other restaurant in the town. Meanwhile in Ramsbottom, Levanter Fine Foods has now closed. However, its sister restaurant, the Basque-influenced Baratxuri, which recently relocated to Manchester city centre, is very much alive and well (baratxuri.co.uk). There\u2019s money in pizza. Fulham Shore, the company that operates the Franco Manca chain as well as the Real Greek group, looks set to accept a cash takeover offer from a Japanese restaurant business called Toridoll Holdings. The offer values Fulham Shore at just shy of \u00a395m and would benefit chairman and co-founder David Page to the tune of \u00a311m. Franco Manca, which started with one site in Brixton market in 2008, now has just over 70 outlets across the UK (francomanca.co.uk). We started with news of closures so let\u2019s finish with news of an opening. Josh and Victoria Overington, who closed their York restaurant Le Cochon Aveugle late last year, have announced the opening in June of My\u0301se, which is pronounced meez and comes from the Anglo Saxon for \u201ceating at the table\u201d. It\u2019s a restaurant with rooms in the North Yorkshire village of Hovingham and as with so many ambitious new openings at the moment, will offer an evening tasting menu. It will cost \u00a3110 a head and will include a duck liver and walnut pie, baked scallop with sea urchin, and goats milk ice-cream with caramelised honey and raspberry juice.

Send Paul Gascoigne in there, along with a handful of other celebrities \u2013 including blind comedian Chris McCausland, who admits he has a slight advantage for once \u2013 and you\u2019ve got this bonkers new reality series, which airs daily for five days. Host Danny Dyer sets the contestants tasks to do in the dark during their stay, driving one of them to nearly throw up and leave within 24 hours. Meanwhile, Eubank is doing everyone\u2019s head in with his philosophising. As Gazza puts it: \u201cEight days like this?

This week, Deborah Meaden, Jay Blades, Judi Love and Mike Wozniak are attempting cheesecakes, vegan fancies and baked renderings of their first crushes.

Between Zoom calls and spurts of distracted writing, I thought about spilling the beans to my sister, but resisted. After two miscarriages, I was wary of sharing the news too early.</p> <p>As noon approached, I started to feel some pangs in my abdomen. At first, I didn\u2019t overthink it: every piece of reproductive literature out there will tell you that cramps, and even light bleeding, are normal during early pregnancy. They subside.</p> <p>For me, they only got worse. The spotting became heavy bleeding, while mild cramps turned into agonizing stabs of pain on my right side.</p> <p>\u201cI think you need to come home,\u201d I texted my husband, who was at work. This was not a normal miscarriage.</p> <p>Mercifully, the nearest emergency department was only a 10-minute drive away. There, the nurse immediately suspected what an ultrasound later confirmed. The pregnancy had been ectopic, meaning it had implanted outside the uterus \u2013 in my case, near the opening of my right fallopian tube, which burst.</p> <p>Because it ruptured so early, my surrounding organs would probably not be damaged. But the pregnancy, as with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/ectopic-pregnancy-symptoms-treatment.html\">all ectopic pregnancies</a>, was not viable. It would need to be surgically aborted, and fast, to stop internal bleeding and prevent infection, both of which can be life-threatening.</p> <p>In simpler terms, I was going to have an abortion and it was going to save my life.</p> <p>I live in California, where access to legal abortion is not in jeopardy, top-quality medical care is plentiful, and lawmakers understand that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/29/ohio-extreme-abortion-bill-reimplant-ectopic-pregnancy\">an ectopic pregnancy cannot be re-implanted</a> into the uterus to develop into a healthy baby.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/13/florida-democrat-lauren-book-fight-six-week-abortion-ban\">\u2018It\u2019s a scary time\u2019: Florida Democrat vows to keep fighting six-week abortion ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My ability to receive the abortion I needed was never in question. But I was not exempt from the fact that in the US, receiving abortion care \u2013 or any medical care \u2013 can be extremely expensive. At the end of it all, I was billed over $55,000, a number that felt unfathomable for someone who grew up in Canada, where under a publicly funded health system, an emergency abortion (<a href=\"https://nafcanada.org/abortion-coverage-region/\">or any abortion</a>, for that matter) would yield no cost to an insured patient.</p> <p>***</p> <p>As I was wheeled off to the OR, I was overwhelmed with relief that I did not live in one of the 13 states that have banned abortion since the US supreme court <a href=\"https://reproductiverights.org/case/scotus-mississippi-abortion-ban/\">ruled to overturn Roe v Wade</a> last June. But as the surgeon explained how they would make a tiny incision in my abdomen to remove my mangled tube and the embryo attached to it, I found myself imagining alternate realities \u2013 and was not comforted.</p> <p>Aborting an ectopic pregnancy is necessary to protect the life of the mother. But in states with abortion bans across the country, exemption clauses that are supposed to reflect those complexities are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/01/21/us/abortion-ban-exceptions.html\">failing</a> to protect women who need care, often because wording is too vague to ensure that a doctor will not be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/10/us/abortion-bans-medical-care-women.html\">prosecuted</a> for doing their job.</p> <p>In Michigan, a woman received a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/07/16/abortion-miscarriage-ectopic-pregnancy-care/\">life-saving abortion for an ectopic pregnancy</a> after she was denied one in her home state. Another woman in Tennessee was told that the only way she could legally terminate her rare <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/tennessee-abortion-ban-doctors-ectopic-pregnancy\">cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy</a> was with a hysterectomy, which would effectively sterilize her. Unable to travel out of state, she was forced to continue the pregnancy, putting her life in grave danger and risking severe complications for the baby. In California, I retained rights that had been stripped from those women, and that protected me from those unthinkable abuses.</p> <p>However, my state did not shield me from other brutal features of American healthcare. I received the first bill about a week after the procedure. I was sitting on the couch, wearing the green sweatsuit I had lived in for seven days, with my abdomen still wrapped in gauze, when an email notified me that the surgeon\u2019s charges had come through: $5,922. About 10 days after that, the hospital\u2019s bill arrived, listing additional services adding up to $49,209.20.</p> <p>I was shocked. I hadn\u2019t even stayed the night, yet, after my private health insurance plan paid its part, I owed over $8,000 for a procedure without which I might have died.</p> <p>And as it turns out, I\u2019m not alone. One New York woman was charged <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/article/ectopic-pregnancy-new-york-abortion-law/\">$80,000</a> for services related to the termination of an ectopic pregnancy \u2013 again, in a state with liberal abortion laws.</p> <p>Across the board, Americans spend more money per capita on healthcare (<a href=\"https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2022/07/how-does-the-us-healthcare-system-compare-to-other-countries\">$12,318 a head in 2021</a>, to be exact) than their peers in other developed nations, yet experience <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2019\">worse health outcomes</a>. This can be attributed to several factors. For one, US healthcare is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5394555/\">profit-motivated</a>, with little stopping providers and pharmaceutical companies from gouging patients. But moreover, its model is made up of a series of disconnected and underregulated systems, leading to <a href=\"https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2020/05/feature-forum-costliest-health-care\">high administrative costs</a> that are passed on to patients.</p> <p>Of course, high costs aren\u2019t exclusive to abortion care. At the hospital I visited, an emergency appendectomy would, in theory, cost the same as my surgery. But a gender bias is baked into the system, especially when it comes to reproductive care.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Women pay significantly more for healthcare than men between their 20s and 40s, largely due to reproductive care and even when they have adequate coverage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/calculating-cost-womens-reproductive-health-care/\">Studies</a> have shown that women pay <a href=\"https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-expenditures-vary-across-population/#Average%20individual%20health%20spending,%202019%C2%A0\">significantly more</a> for healthcare than men between their 20s and 40s, largely due to reproductive care and even when they have adequate coverage. This is despite the fact that covering the costs of sexual and reproductive care is known to not only benefit patients\u2019 health, but also save the overall system <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/report/adding-it-costs-and-benefits-investing-sexual-and-reproductive-health-2014\">a good deal of money</a> \u2013 as encouraging patients to seek early or preventive care typically reduces complications and lowers costs down the line.</p> <p>And abortion bans are making it much worse: not only do they force many women to travel long distances for care, which is expensive, but the extra time required to get care also makes it more complex and, as a result, costlier.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Even in non-emergency situations, abortions in the US are expensive. Typically, where abortion care is legal, it costs between several hundred and several thousand dollars. At a non-profit like Planned Parenthood, abortion costs range from $550-800. At a hospital or private clinic, price tags can be much higher.</p> <p>\u201cCost for an abortion has always been a big hurdle for people who are trying to just get the care that they need,\u201d said Dailienis Garcia, senior director of abortion access, funding and navigation for Planned Parenthood.

My fertility app \u2013 one of several pinned on my phone\u2019s home screen, I am reluctant to admit \u2013 told me that the embryo growing inside me was the size of a green pea. That morning, I felt both elated and nervous. Between Zoom calls and spurts of distracted writing, I thought about spilling the beans to my sister, but resisted. After two miscarriages, I was wary of sharing the news too early. As noon approached, I started to feel some pangs in my abdomen. At first, I didn\u2019t overthink it: every piece of reproductive literature out there will tell you that cramps, and even light bleeding, are normal during early pregnancy. They subside. For me, they only got worse. The spotting became heavy bleeding, while mild cramps turned into agonizing stabs of pain on my right side. \u201cI think you need to come home,\u201d I texted my husband, who was at work. This was not a normal miscarriage. Mercifully, the nearest emergency department was only a 10-minute drive away. There, the nurse immediately suspected what an ultrasound later confirmed. The pregnancy had been ectopic, meaning it had implanted outside the uterus \u2013 in my case, near the opening of my right fallopian tube, which burst. Because it ruptured so early, my surrounding organs would probably not be damaged. But the pregnancy, as with all ectopic pregnancies, was not viable. It would need to be surgically aborted, and fast, to stop internal bleeding and prevent infection, both of which can be life-threatening. In simpler terms, I was going to have an abortion and it was going to save my life. I live in California, where access to legal abortion is not in jeopardy, top-quality medical care is plentiful, and lawmakers understand that an ectopic pregnancy cannot be re-implanted into the uterus to develop into a healthy baby. My ability to receive the abortion I needed was never in question. But I was not exempt from the fact that in the US, receiving abortion care \u2013 or any medical care \u2013 can be extremely expensive. At the end of it all, I was billed over $55,000, a number that felt unfathomable for someone who grew up in Canada, where under a publicly funded health system, an emergency abortion (or any abortion, for that matter) would yield no cost to an insured patient. *** As I was wheeled off to the OR, I was overwhelmed with relief that I did not live in one of the 13 states that have banned abortion since the US supreme court ruled to overturn Roe v Wade last June. But as the surgeon explained how they would make a tiny incision in my abdomen to remove my mangled tube and the embryo attached to it, I found myself imagining alternate realities \u2013 and was not comforted. Aborting an ectopic pregnancy is necessary to protect the life of the mother. But in states with abortion bans across the country, exemption clauses that are supposed to reflect those complexities are failing to protect women who need care, often because wording is too vague to ensure that a doctor will not be prosecuted for doing their job. In Michigan, a woman received a life-saving abortion for an ectopic pregnancy after she was denied one in her home state. Another woman in Tennessee was told that the only way she could legally terminate her rare cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy was with a hysterectomy, which would effectively sterilize her. Unable to travel out of state, she was forced to continue the pregnancy, putting her life in grave danger and risking severe complications for the baby. In California, I retained rights that had been stripped from those women, and that protected me from those unthinkable abuses. However, my state did not shield me from other brutal features of American healthcare. I received the first bill about a week after the procedure. I was sitting on the couch, wearing the green sweatsuit I had lived in for seven days, with my abdomen still wrapped in gauze, when an email notified me that the surgeon\u2019s charges had come through: $5,922. About 10 days after that, the hospital\u2019s bill arrived, listing additional services adding up to $49,209.20. I was shocked. I hadn\u2019t even stayed the night, yet, after my private health insurance plan paid its part, I owed over $8,000 for a procedure without which I might have died. And as it turns out, I\u2019m not alone. One New York woman was charged $80,000 for services related to the termination of an ectopic pregnancy \u2013 again, in a state with liberal abortion laws. Across the board, Americans spend more money per capita on healthcare ($12,318 a head in 2021, to be exact) than their peers in other developed nations, yet experience worse health outcomes. This can be attributed to several factors. For one, US healthcare is profit-motivated, with little stopping providers and pharmaceutical companies from gouging patients. But moreover, its model is made up of a series of disconnected and underregulated systems, leading to high administrative costs that are passed on to patients. Of course, high costs aren\u2019t exclusive to abortion care. At the hospital I visited, an emergency appendectomy would, in theory, cost the same as my surgery. But a gender bias is baked into the system, especially when it comes to reproductive care. Studies have shown that women pay significantly more for healthcare than men between their 20s and 40s, largely due to reproductive care and even when they have adequate coverage. This is despite the fact that covering the costs of sexual and reproductive care is known to not only benefit patients\u2019 health, but also save the overall system a good deal of money \u2013 as encouraging patients to seek early or preventive care typically reduces complications and lowers costs down the line. And abortion bans are making it much worse: not only do they force many women to travel long distances for care, which is expensive, but the extra time required to get care also makes it more complex and, as a result, costlier. *** Even in non-emergency situations, abortions in the US are expensive. Typically, where abortion care is legal, it costs between several hundred and several thousand dollars. At a non-profit like Planned Parenthood, abortion costs range from $550-800. At a hospital or private clinic, price tags can be much higher. \u201cCost for an abortion has always been a big hurdle for people who are trying to just get the care that they need,\u201d said Dailienis Garcia, senior director of abortion access, funding and navigation for Planned Parenthood. She explained that even in states that are abortion-friendly, requirements pushed by actors hostile to abortion, like multiple in-person appointments or medically unnecessary ultrasounds, have historically driven up prices. Among the remaining states with unrestricted access, just 16 cover abortion through state Medicaid programs, an enduring legacy of the 1976 Hyde Amendment that blocked the use of federal Medicaid funding for abortion coverage. As a result, many low-income patients have to pay out of pocket. \u201cThe impact \u2026 is felt largely by Black, Latino and Indigenous people, immigrants, people living with low incomes and people in rural areas,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWealthy individuals will always be able to access abortions.\u201d That disparity in access extends to other aspects of reproductive care, too. For instance, although federal law requires insurance plans to cover contraception, patients pay high fees for birth control pills or IUD insertions. Fertility care \u2013including fertility testing and assisted reproductive technology like IUI or IVF \u2013 is rarely covered by insurance plans and out-of-pocket charges in the US often reach into the tens of thousands of dollars. (In Europe, by way of contrast, most countries heavily subsidize fertility treatments.) In all of these realms, people with lower incomes face barriers to care that do not exist for the wealthy in America. But reproductive care doesn\u2019t need to \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t \u2013 cost as much as it does. Across the border, in Canada, physician and hospital services cost a fraction of what they do here in the US. For a straightforward abortion that takes place before 14 weeks of gestation, a physician in Ontario can bill C$112.40 (US$83). In California, prices start at $250 for patients insured by Medicaid. Dr Alisha Olsthoorn, an OB-GYN at Toronto\u2019s Mount Sinai hospital, said that she will typically bill C$307 (about US$225) for a laparoscopic salpingectomy \u2013 the same surgery that cost me $5,900 in Berkeley. \u201cIf it\u2019s the middle of the night, I\u2019d bill more,\u201d said Olsthoorn, explaining that she would add a 75% surcharge for an after-hours surgery. At Scarborough Health Network, also in Toronto, hospital costs for an ectopic pregnancy needing a surgical abortion average C$5,608.00 and include an overnight stay (which was not among the amenities provided in my $49k hospital bill). And even those costs are covered by the government \u2013 not the patient. So why was it that at Sutter, my hospital charges were nearly 10 times that amount? \u201cThey basically make it up,\u201d said Karen Pollitz, senior fellow and co-director of the program on patient and consumer protections in health insurance for Kaiser Family Foundation, who added that \u201cbilled amounts are whatever the doc and the hospital feel like billing you\u201d. As a result, fees in the US can be not only arbitrary, but also grossly inflated, and rarely reflect the actual costs of services \u2013 even when certain hospitals are ostensibly non-profit.

But in states with abortion bans across the country, exemption clauses that are supposed to reflect those complexities are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/01/21/us/abortion-ban-exceptions.html\">failing</a> to protect women who need care, often because wording is too vague to ensure that a doctor will not be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/10/us/abortion-bans-medical-care-women.html\">prosecuted</a> for doing their job.</p> <p>In Michigan, a woman received a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/07/16/abortion-miscarriage-ectopic-pregnancy-care/\">life-saving abortion for an ectopic pregnancy</a> after she was denied one in her home state. Another woman in Tennessee was told that the only way she could legally terminate her rare <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/tennessee-abortion-ban-doctors-ectopic-pregnancy\">cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy</a> was with a hysterectomy, which would effectively sterilize her. Unable to travel out of state, she was forced to continue the pregnancy, putting her life in grave danger and risking severe complications for the baby. In California, I retained rights that had been stripped from those women, and that protected me from those unthinkable abuses.</p> <p>However, my state did not shield me from other brutal features of American healthcare. I received the first bill about a week after the procedure. I was sitting on the couch, wearing the green sweatsuit I had lived in for seven days, with my abdomen still wrapped in gauze, when an email notified me that the surgeon\u2019s charges had come through: $5,922. About 10 days after that, the hospital\u2019s bill arrived, listing additional services adding up to $49,209.20.</p> <p>I was shocked. I hadn\u2019t even stayed the night, yet, after my private health insurance plan paid its part, I owed over $8,000 for a procedure without which I might have died.</p> <p>And as it turns out, I\u2019m not alone. One New York woman was charged <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/article/ectopic-pregnancy-new-york-abortion-law/\">$80,000</a> for services related to the termination of an ectopic pregnancy \u2013 again, in a state with liberal abortion laws.</p> <p>Across the board, Americans spend more money per capita on healthcare (<a href=\"https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2022/07/how-does-the-us-healthcare-system-compare-to-other-countries\">$12,318 a head in 2021</a>, to be exact) than their peers in other developed nations, yet experience <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2019\">worse health outcomes</a>. This can be attributed to several factors. For one, US healthcare is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5394555/\">profit-motivated</a>, with little stopping providers and pharmaceutical companies from gouging patients. But moreover, its model is made up of a series of disconnected and underregulated systems, leading to <a href=\"https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2020/05/feature-forum-costliest-health-care\">high administrative costs</a> that are passed on to patients.</p> <p>Of course, high costs aren\u2019t exclusive to abortion care. At the hospital I visited, an emergency appendectomy would, in theory, cost the same as my surgery. But a gender bias is baked into the system, especially when it comes to reproductive care.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Women pay significantly more for healthcare than men between their 20s and 40s, largely due to reproductive care and even when they have adequate coverage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/calculating-cost-womens-reproductive-health-care/\">Studies</a> have shown that women pay <a href=\"https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-expenditures-vary-across-population/#Average%20individual%20health%20spending,%202019%C2%A0\">significantly more</a> for healthcare than men between their 20s and 40s, largely due to reproductive care and even when they have adequate coverage. This is despite the fact that covering the costs of sexual and reproductive care is known to not only benefit patients\u2019 health, but also save the overall system <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/report/adding-it-costs-and-benefits-investing-sexual-and-reproductive-health-2014\">a good deal of money</a> \u2013 as encouraging patients to seek early or preventive care typically reduces complications and lowers costs down the line.</p> <p>And abortion bans are making it much worse: not only do they force many women to travel long distances for care, which is expensive, but the extra time required to get care also makes it more complex and, as a result, costlier.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Even in non-emergency situations, abortions in the US are expensive. Typically, where abortion care is legal, it costs between several hundred and several thousand dollars. At a non-profit like Planned Parenthood, abortion costs range from $550-800. At a hospital or private clinic, price tags can be much higher.</p> <p>\u201cCost for an abortion has always been a big hurdle for people who are trying to just get the care that they need,\u201d said Dailienis Garcia, senior director of abortion access, funding and navigation for Planned Parenthood. She explained that even in states that are abortion-friendly, requirements pushed by actors hostile to abortion, like multiple in-person appointments or medically unnecessary ultrasounds, have historically driven up prices.</p> <p>Among the remaining states with unrestricted access, just <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/abortion-under-medicaid/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D\">16</a> cover abortion through state Medicaid programs, an enduring legacy of the <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/federal-and-state-bans-and-restrictions-abortion/hyde-amendment\">1976 Hyde Amendment</a> that blocked the use of federal Medicaid funding for abortion coverage. As a result, many low-income patients have to pay out of pocket.</p> <p>\u201cThe impact \u2026 is felt largely by Black, Latino and Indigenous people, immigrants, people living with low incomes and people in rural areas,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWealthy individuals will always be able to access abortions.\u201d</p> <p>That disparity in access extends to other aspects of reproductive care, too. For instance, although <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/07/21/1018483557/contraception-is-free-to-women-except-when-its-not\">federal law requires</a> insurance plans to cover contraception, patients pay high fees for birth control pills or IUD insertions. Fertility care \u2013including fertility testing and <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/health/2022/05/fertility-treatment-costs-california/\">assisted reproductive technology</a> like IUI or IVF \u2013 is rarely covered by insurance plans and out-of-pocket charges in the US often reach into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/30/ivf-fertility-treatment-lets-talk-about-costs-insurance-coverage\">tens of thousands of dollars</a>. (In Europe, by way of contrast, <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/226090/No_12_September_2016_in_vitro_fertilisation.pdf\">most countries heavily subsidize fertility treatments</a>.) In all of these realms, people with lower incomes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/nov/28/who-can-afford-ivf-treatments-fertility-class\">face barriers to care</a> that do not exist for the wealthy in America.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ebd9d18f2ad5de4b325f9de9aed0072b53284aae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebd9d18f2ad5de4b325f9de9aed0072b53284aae/0_0_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman sitting at table looking at hospital bill. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In all of these realms, people with lower incomes face barriers to care that do not exist for the wealthy in America.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Mathilde Vogt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But reproductive care doesn\u2019t need to \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t \u2013 cost as much as it does. Across the border, in Canada, physician and hospital services cost a fraction of what they do here in the US.</p> <p>For a straightforward abortion that takes place before 14 weeks of gestation, a physician in Ontario can bill <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/ohip/sob/\">C$112.40</a> (US$83). In California, <a href=\"https://files.medi-cal.ca.gov/rates/rates_download.aspx\">prices start at $250</a> for patients insured by Medicaid.</p> <p>Dr Alisha Olsthoorn, an OB-GYN at Toronto\u2019s Mount Sinai hospital, said that she will typically bill C$307 (about US$225) for a laparoscopic salpingectomy \u2013 the same surgery that cost me $5,900 in Berkeley.</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the middle of the night, I\u2019d bill more,\u201d said Olsthoorn, explaining that she would add a 75% surcharge for an after-hours surgery.</p> <p>At Scarborough Health Network, also in Toronto, hospital costs for an ectopic pregnancy needing a surgical abortion average C$5,608.00 and include an overnight stay (which was not among the amenities provided in my $49k hospital bill).</p> <p>And even those costs are covered by the government \u2013 not the patient.</p> <p>So why was it that at Sutter, my hospital charges were nearly 10 times that amount?</p> <p>\u201cThey basically make it up,\u201d said Karen Pollitz, senior fellow and co-director of the program on patient and consumer protections in health insurance for Kaiser Family Foundation, who added that \u201cbilled amounts are whatever the doc and the hospital feel like billing you\u201d.</p> <p>As a result, fees in the US can be not only <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospital-prices-arbitrary-healthcare-medical-bills-insurance-11635428943\">arbitrary</a>, but also grossly inflated, and rarely reflect the actual costs of services \u2013 even when certain hospitals are ostensibly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/25/podcasts/the-daily/nonprofit-hospitals-investigation.html\">non-profit</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>When you have to deal with this is often when you\u2019re least equipped to do so because you\u2019re going through a scary health crisis.</p> <footer> <cite>Karen Pollitz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pollitz went on to say that while insurance groups are supposed to act as fiscal gatekeepers that keep tabs on how much a hospital charges subscribers, unfair billing practices often go unnoticed. Most often, patients must shoulder the burden of either paying or fighting for charges to be lowered \u2013 something that takes time and energy.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you have to deal with this is often when you\u2019re least equipped to do so because you\u2019re going through a scary health crisis \u2026 you\u2019re sick or sad because you lost a pregnancy,\u201d said Pollitz. \u201cIt\u2019s just not nice to do to sick people.\u201d</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p>Since 1 January 2021, hospitals across the country have had to comply with the federal government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/hospital-price-transparencynew%20york%20tim\">hospital price transparency</a> rule, which requires they make their pricing for services offered publicly available. The rule has exposed just <a href=\"https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/price-transparency-and-variation-in-u-s-health-services/\">how widely costs for a single procedure can vary</a> from place to place, insurer to insurer and patient to patient. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/22/upshot/hospital-prices.html\">costs for an MRI at Mass General, for example, range from $877 to over $4,000</a>, depending on a patient\u2019s insurance plan.</p> <p>After digesting the scale of the charges I had received from Sutter Health, a hospital behemoth that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/health/sutter-hospitals-medical-bills.html\">has been accused</a> of inflating costs in the past, I began to dig. My hospital listed \u201cAll services for surgery related to an ectopic pregnancy\u201d as ranging from $7,500 and nearly $37,000 for people with Blue Shield insurance.</p> <p>When I asked Pollitz how that squares with my $50,000 in hospital charges, she explained that without any federal oversight, hospitals have no incentive to stick to the charges they post online.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re just a horrible mess,\u201d Pollitz said of the transparency data, explaining that hospitals do not clarify whether listed prices are \u201ccomprehensive\u201d or \u201cpartial\u201d. Indeed, when I called to contest the cost, a Sutter billing representative said that the \u201call services\u201d price listed on their website \u201cmay just be part of the procedure\u201d and probably didn\u2019t include \u201cpharmacy, layups, IVs, emergency room and anesthesia\u201d charges. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f45b130b16b777e6b172d12e98c07bc962ecfa08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f45b130b16b777e6b172d12e98c07bc962ecfa08/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People participate in a pro-choice rally in Washington DC in January 2023.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People participate in a pro-choice rally in Washington DC in January 2023.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aurora Samperio/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a statement to the Guardian, Sutter Health seemed to suggest it was impossible to set prices in advance for emergencies. \u201cSutter and commercial health insurance companies typically do not have set negotiated rates for services provided in emergency care settings. Generally, this is because emergency services and individual patient circumstances can vary widely,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cWe always listen to patient feedback and continually review our processes to find ways to improve the patient experience and make the billing process more clear.\u201d</p> <p>But patients do have options for recourse when bills are unjustly high. A person can ask the hospital for charges to be reviewed and for clear descriptions of items listed as \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d. (Just note that it doesn\u2019t always work. After formally reviewing my bill, Sutter notified me that the charges were, in their eyes, accurate.)</p> <p>Contacting one\u2019s insurance plan is another important step, said Pollitz, as lower overall charges also benefit insurers, who are usually responsible for paying a percentage of the bill. But filing a grievance can be frustrating, time-consuming and re-traumatizing. When I called my insurance plan\u2019s customer service line to inquire about the charges, I was told it was my job to research costs before getting surgery, and that it wasn\u2019t their fault that I had failed to do so.</p> <p>\u201cDid you get the price for your surgery approved in advance?\u201d a representative from Blue Shield California asked me over the phone about my emergency surgical abortion.</p> <p>The question rang as absurd. Reproductive care is not predictable and if a patient delays seeking emergency care because they are nervous about costs, their condition could become more dangerous and expensive. Prohibitive costs, therefore, not only discourage people from seeking care, but also help contribute to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/20/us-maternal-mortality-rate-climbing-health-crisis#:~:text=America%20is%20in%20a,of%20maternal%20causes%20that%20year.\">US\u2019s exceptionally high maternal mortality rates</a>.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t plan to have an ectopic pregnancy,\u201d I told the representative.</p> <p>\u201cThen this charge is correct,\u201d she responded.

About 10 days after that, the hospital\u2019s bill arrived, listing additional services adding up to $49,209.20. I was shocked. I hadn\u2019t even stayed the night, yet, after my private health insurance plan paid its part, I owed over $8,000 for a procedure without which I might have died. And as it turns out, I\u2019m not alone. One New York woman was charged $80,000 for services related to the termination of an ectopic pregnancy \u2013 again, in a state with liberal abortion laws. Across the board, Americans spend more money per capita on healthcare ($12,318 a head in 2021, to be exact) than their peers in other developed nations, yet experience worse health outcomes. This can be attributed to several factors. For one, US healthcare is profit-motivated, with little stopping providers and pharmaceutical companies from gouging patients. But moreover, its model is made up of a series of disconnected and underregulated systems, leading to high administrative costs that are passed on to patients. Of course, high costs aren\u2019t exclusive to abortion care. At the hospital I visited, an emergency appendectomy would, in theory, cost the same as my surgery. But a gender bias is baked into the system, especially when it comes to reproductive care.\nStudies have shown that women pay significantly more for healthcare than men between their 20s and 40s, largely due to reproductive care and even when they have adequate coverage. This is despite the fact that covering the costs of sexual and reproductive care is known to not only benefit patients\u2019 health, but also save the overall system a good deal of money \u2013 as encouraging patients to seek early or preventive care typically reduces complications and lowers costs down the line. And abortion bans are making it much worse: not only do they force many women to travel long distances for care, which is expensive, but the extra time required to get care also makes it more complex and, as a result, costlier. *** Even in non-emergency situations, abortions in the US are expensive. Typically, where abortion care is legal, it costs between several hundred and several thousand dollars. At a non-profit like Planned Parenthood, abortion costs range from $550-800. At a hospital or private clinic, price tags can be much higher. \u201cCost for an abortion has always been a big hurdle for people who are trying to just get the care that they need,\u201d said Dailienis Garcia, senior director of abortion access, funding and navigation for Planned Parenthood. She explained that even in states that are abortion-friendly, requirements pushed by actors hostile to abortion, like multiple in-person appointments or medically unnecessary ultrasounds, have historically driven up prices. Among the remaining states with unrestricted access, just 16 cover abortion through state Medicaid programs, an enduring legacy of the 1976 Hyde Amendment that blocked the use of federal Medicaid funding for abortion coverage. As a result, many low-income patients have to pay out of pocket. \u201cThe impact \u2026 is felt largely by Black, Latino and Indigenous people, immigrants, people living with low incomes and people in rural areas,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWealthy individuals will always be able to access abortions.\u201d That disparity in access extends to other aspects of reproductive care, too. For instance, although federal law requires insurance plans to cover contraception, patients pay high fees for birth control pills or IUD insertions. Fertility care \u2013including fertility testing and assisted reproductive technology like IUI or IVF \u2013 is rarely covered by insurance plans and out-of-pocket charges in the US often reach into the tens of thousands of dollars. (In Europe, by way of contrast, most countries heavily subsidize fertility treatments.) In all of these realms, people with lower incomes face barriers to care that do not exist for the wealthy in America.\nBut reproductive care doesn\u2019t need to \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t \u2013 cost as much as it does. Across the border, in Canada, physician and hospital services cost a fraction of what they do here in the US. For a straightforward abortion that takes place before 14 weeks of gestation, a physician in Ontario can bill C$112.40 (US$83). In California, prices start at $250 for patients insured by Medicaid. Dr Alisha Olsthoorn, an OB-GYN at Toronto\u2019s Mount Sinai hospital, said that she will typically bill C$307 (about US$225) for a laparoscopic salpingectomy \u2013 the same surgery that cost me $5,900 in Berkeley. \u201cIf it\u2019s the middle of the night, I\u2019d bill more,\u201d said Olsthoorn, explaining that she would add a 75% surcharge for an after-hours surgery. At Scarborough Health Network, also in Toronto, hospital costs for an ectopic pregnancy needing a surgical abortion average C$5,608.00 and include an overnight stay (which was not among the amenities provided in my $49k hospital bill). And even those costs are covered by the government \u2013 not the patient. So why was it that at Sutter, my hospital charges were nearly 10 times that amount? \u201cThey basically make it up,\u201d said Karen Pollitz, senior fellow and co-director of the program on patient and consumer protections in health insurance for Kaiser Family Foundation, who added that \u201cbilled amounts are whatever the doc and the hospital feel like billing you\u201d. As a result, fees in the US can be not only arbitrary, but also grossly inflated, and rarely reflect the actual costs of services \u2013 even when certain hospitals are ostensibly non-profit.\nPollitz went on to say that while insurance groups are supposed to act as fiscal gatekeepers that keep tabs on how much a hospital charges subscribers, unfair billing practices often go unnoticed. Most often, patients must shoulder the burden of either paying or fighting for charges to be lowered \u2013 something that takes time and energy. \u201cWhen you have to deal with this is often when you\u2019re least equipped to do so because you\u2019re going through a scary health crisis \u2026 you\u2019re sick or sad because you lost a pregnancy,\u201d said Pollitz. \u201cIt\u2019s just not nice to do to sick people.\u201d *** Since 1 January 2021, hospitals across the country have had to comply with the federal government\u2019s hospital price transparency rule, which requires they make their pricing for services offered publicly available. The rule has exposed just how widely costs for a single procedure can vary from place to place, insurer to insurer and patient to patient. The costs for an MRI at Mass General, for example, range from $877 to over $4,000, depending on a patient\u2019s insurance plan. After digesting the scale of the charges I had received from Sutter Health, a hospital behemoth that has been accused of inflating costs in the past, I began to dig. My hospital listed \u201cAll services for surgery related to an ectopic pregnancy\u201d as ranging from $7,500 and nearly $37,000 for people with Blue Shield insurance. When I asked Pollitz how that squares with my $50,000 in hospital charges, she explained that without any federal oversight, hospitals have no incentive to stick to the charges they post online. \u201cThey\u2019re just a horrible mess,\u201d Pollitz said of the transparency data, explaining that hospitals do not clarify whether listed prices are \u201ccomprehensive\u201d or \u201cpartial\u201d. Indeed, when I called to contest the cost, a Sutter billing representative said that the \u201call services\u201d price listed on their website \u201cmay just be part of the procedure\u201d and probably didn\u2019t include \u201cpharmacy, layups, IVs, emergency room and anesthesia\u201d charges.\nIn a statement to the Guardian, Sutter Health seemed to suggest it was impossible to set prices in advance for emergencies. \u201cSutter and commercial health insurance companies typically do not have set negotiated rates for services provided in emergency care settings. Generally, this is because emergency services and individual patient circumstances can vary widely,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cWe always listen to patient feedback and continually review our processes to find ways to improve the patient experience and make the billing process more clear.\u201d But patients do have options for recourse when bills are unjustly high. A person can ask the hospital for charges to be reviewed and for clear descriptions of items listed as \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d. (Just note that it doesn\u2019t always work. After formally reviewing my bill, Sutter notified me that the charges were, in their eyes, accurate.) Contacting one\u2019s insurance plan is another important step, said Pollitz, as lower overall charges also benefit insurers, who are usually responsible for paying a percentage of the bill. But filing a grievance can be frustrating, time-consuming and re-traumatizing. When I called my insurance plan\u2019s customer service line to inquire about the charges, I was told it was my job to research costs before getting surgery, and that it wasn\u2019t their fault that I had failed to do so. \u201cDid you get the price for your surgery approved in advance?\u201d a representative from Blue Shield California asked me over the phone about my emergency surgical abortion. The question rang as absurd. Reproductive care is not predictable and if a patient delays seeking emergency care because they are nervous about costs, their condition could become more dangerous and expensive. Prohibitive costs, therefore, not only discourage people from seeking care, but also help contribute to the US\u2019s exceptionally high maternal mortality rates. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t plan to have an ectopic pregnancy,\u201d I told the representative. \u201cThen this charge is correct,\u201d she responded.

The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/22/upshot/hospital-prices.html\">costs for an MRI at Mass General, for example, range from $877 to over $4,000</a>, depending on a patient\u2019s insurance plan.</p> \n<p>After digesting the scale of the charges I had received from Sutter Health, a hospital behemoth that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/health/sutter-hospitals-medical-bills.html\">has been accused</a> of inflating costs in the past, I began to dig. My hospital listed \u201cAll services for surgery related to an ectopic pregnancy\u201d as ranging from $7,500 and nearly $37,000 for people with Blue Shield insurance.</p> \n<p>When I asked Pollitz how that squares with my $50,000 in hospital charges, she explained that without any federal oversight, hospitals have no incentive to stick to the charges they post online.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re just a horrible mess,\u201d Pollitz said of the transparency data, explaining that hospitals do not clarify whether listed prices are \u201ccomprehensive\u201d or \u201cpartial\u201d. Indeed, when I called to contest the cost, a Sutter billing representative said that the \u201call services\u201d price listed on their website \u201cmay just be part of the procedure\u201d and probably didn\u2019t include \u201cpharmacy, layups, IVs, emergency room and anesthesia\u201d charges. </p>"}}, {"type": "image", "assets": [{"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f45b130b16b777e6b172d12e98c07bc962ecfa08/0_0_5472_3648/5472.jpg", "typeData": {"width": 5472, "height": 3648}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f45b130b16b777e6b172d12e98c07bc962ecfa08/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg", "typeData": {"width": 5472, "height": 3648, "isMaster": true}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f45b130b16b777e6b172d12e98c07bc962ecfa08/0_0_5472_3648/2000.jpg", "typeData": {"width": 2000, "height": 1333}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f45b130b16b777e6b172d12e98c07bc962ecfa08/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg", "typeData": {"width": 1000, "height": 667}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f45b130b16b777e6b172d12e98c07bc962ecfa08/0_0_5472_3648/500.jpg", "typeData": {"width": 500, "height": 333}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f45b130b16b777e6b172d12e98c07bc962ecfa08/0_0_5472_3648/140.jpg", "typeData": {"width": 140, "height": 93}}], "imageTypeData": {"caption": "People participate in a pro-choice rally in Washington DC in January 2023.", "displayCredit": true, "credit": "Photograph: Aurora Samperio/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock", "source": "NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock", "photographer": "Aurora Samperio", "alt": "People participate in a pro-choice rally in Washington DC in January 2023.", "mediaId": "f45b130b16b777e6b172d12e98c07bc962ecfa08", "mediaApiUri": "https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/f45b130b16b777e6b172d12e98c07bc962ecfa08", "suppliersReference": "13730899l", "imageType": "Photograph"}}, {"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>In a statement to the Guardian, Sutter Health seemed to suggest it was impossible to set prices in advance for emergencies. \u201cSutter and commercial health insurance companies typically do not have set negotiated rates for services provided in emergency care settings. Generally, this is because emergency services and individual patient circumstances can vary widely,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cWe always listen to patient feedback and continually review our processes to find ways to improve the patient experience and make the billing process more clear.\u201d</p> \n<p>But patients do have options for recourse when bills are unjustly high. A person can ask the hospital for charges to be reviewed and for clear descriptions of items listed as \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d. (Just note that it doesn\u2019t always work. After formally reviewing my bill, Sutter notified me that the charges were, in their eyes, accurate.)</p> \n<p>Contacting one\u2019s insurance plan is another important step, said Pollitz, as lower overall charges also benefit insurers, who are usually responsible for paying a percentage of the bill. But filing a grievance can be frustrating, time-consuming and re-traumatizing. When I called my insurance plan\u2019s customer service line to inquire about the charges, I was told it was my job to research costs before getting surgery, and that it wasn\u2019t their fault that I had failed to do so.</p> \n<p>\u201cDid you get the price for your surgery approved in advance?\u201d a representative from Blue Shield California asked me over the phone about my emergency surgical abortion.</p> \n<p>The question rang as absurd. Reproductive care is not predictable and if a patient delays seeking emergency care because they are nervous about costs, their condition could become more dangerous and expensive. Prohibitive costs, therefore, not only discourage people from seeking care, but also help contribute to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/20/us-maternal-mortality-rate-climbing-health-crisis#:~:text=America%20is%20in%20a,of%20maternal%20causes%20that%20year.\">US\u2019s exceptionally high maternal mortality rates</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t plan to have an ectopic pregnancy,\u201d I told the representative.</p> \n<p>\u201cThen this charge is correct,\u201d she responded.

It was our responsibility to make sure their voices were heard,\u201d Slovo has said.</p> \n<p>The story will be told for TV by the screenwriter and film-maker Peter Kosminsky, who adapted and directed <em>Wolf Hall</em> for television. Kosminsky and his collaborator, producer Ahmed Peerbux, are making a three-part drama, but it is a long-term project and not likely to be broadcast for at least two years. \u201cAhmed and I started working on this series a few days after the fire,\u201d Kosminsky told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cHe had been volunteering at the scene, along with his wife.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kosminsky, who has worked in television for 43 years, regards this drama as his most challenging so far. \u201cWe have spoken to a great number of people off camera from every group affected, from the bereaved to volunteers and those who worked in hospitals. In fact, the actual fire will take up a fairly small part of the drama,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will begin months before and will cover the botched refurbishments. And we will go on long after the fire, well into the woeful responses to the disaster.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kosminsky\u2019s script will use multiple perspectives, he said. The team attended each day of the public inquiry.</p>"}}, {"type": "image", "assets": [{"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2d489db84c9aad1757b5edf0546e3ed0261fc688/0_210_3505_4379/3505.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "4:5", "width": 3505, "height": 4379}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2d489db84c9aad1757b5edf0546e3ed0261fc688/0_210_3505_4379/master/3505.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "4:5", "width": 3505, "height": 4379, "isMaster": true}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2d489db84c9aad1757b5edf0546e3ed0261fc688/0_210_3505_4379/1601.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "4:5", "width": 1601, "height": 2000}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2d489db84c9aad1757b5edf0546e3ed0261fc688/0_210_3505_4379/800.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "4:5", "width": 800, "height": 1000}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2d489db84c9aad1757b5edf0546e3ed0261fc688/0_210_3505_4379/400.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "4:5", "width": 400, "height": 500}}], "imageTypeData": {"caption": "Steve McQueen\u2019s silent film about the aftermath of Grenfell has been praised by local residents.", "displayCredit": true, "credit": "Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images", "source": "Getty Images", "photographer": "Frazer Harrison", "alt": "Portrait of Steve McQueen wearing a black shirt", "mediaId": "2d489db84c9aad1757b5edf0546e3ed0261fc688", "mediaApiUri": "https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/2d489db84c9aad1757b5edf0546e3ed0261fc688", "suppliersReference": "1433711250", "imageType": "Photograph", "role": "supporting"}}, {"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>\u201cOur drama certainly is not going to be the story of one or two people trapped on the 17th floor, or something like that,\u201d said Kosminsky, adding: \u201cI have never worked on anything that has gone into something as deeply and fully.

It was a terrible tragedy and it was avoidable.\u201d</p> \n<p>Not every resident is opposed to the productions. One survivor, Hanan Wahabi, spoke out in support of the play: \u201cWith each year that goes by our pain doesn\u2019t stop, but we must keep our stories alive and at the forefront of people\u2019s minds.

Industry sources say the federal climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, will release the strategy ahead of an event in western Sydney on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting something quite ambitious,\u201d said one of those briefed. Bowen\u2019s office declined to confirm the timing or details of the strategy, saying only it \u201cwill be launched soon.\u201d The plans will \u201cprovide a nationally consistent, comprehensive framework to looking at supply, demand and infrastructure needs for cleaner and cheaper vehicles\u201d, a spokesperson said.\nAustralia is the only OECD nation to not have, or be in the process of developing, fuel efficiency standards. Bowen said last August that Australian consumers could choose between just eight low-emissions vehicles under $60,000, compared with 26 available in the UK. Impetus has only gathered internationally since then, with the US becoming the latest country to flag much stricter emissions standards.

In their Pozible campaign, Shane and Leanne \u2013 who also co-own Melbourne\u2019s Last Chance rock\u2019n\u2019roll bar \u2013 claim the hotel risks being \u201cturned into apartments, or worse one of those fucking awful redeveloped tissue box pubs run to make as much money as possible with no dirty rock &amp; roll in sight\u201d. If they can buy the Tote, Hilton said they will set up a charitable trust to manage the venue, which they say would be the first of its kind in Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put it into a trust, and then eventually what will happen is we will hand the building over to an independent charitable organisation who will own the Tote for the rest of time,\u201d Hilton said. Melbourne is a cornerstone of Australia\u2019s live music scene \u2013 last year, five out of the six Australian acts at Glastonbury were from Victoria. But venues have struggled since the end of the pandemic lockdowns, with Jimmy Hornet and Colour both closing. The Curtin was saved when the new owner agreed to sign a 10-year lease, and Footscray\u2019s Hotel Westwood is for sale. Hilton said without drastic intervention, closures will keep happening. \u201cLive music venues and pubs are on prime development land,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many of them have been turned into apartments. These spaces are disappearing. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a model that can be used in other venues to protect spaces. It\u2019s something governments could look at and fine-tune. \u201cThese spaces are important, they\u2019re community spaces. It\u2019s not the walls, it\u2019s what\u2019s happens within them.\u201d On top of the fundraiser, the pair have contributed what they could. While he cannot say how much the offer was, it came under the asking price of $6.6m. Hilton said: \u201cWe put an offer in, that we could basically afford. \u201cWe put it in with the hope that the campaign would make it to $3m.\u201d So far, in terms of his tattoo offer to life membership donors, he has over 70 tattoos. \u201cI\u2019ve got over 650 still to be tattooed on me,\u201d Hilton said. \u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of room, I\u2019ve only got one whole leg, a thigh and my buttocks. \u201cEven if we fail, it\u2019ll be a reminder of how strong the community is.\u201d Pozible\u2019s Alan Crabbe said the campaign was the biggest in live music history. \u201cWith over 5200 supporters, I cannot think of any campaign in the music industry internationally that has garnered so much support,\u201d Crabbe said. \u201cOverwhelmingly, many supporters view this venue as a Melbourne institution, that must be preserved for future generations to experience \u2013 as they did.\u201d The current co-owners did not reply to questions before deadline, but said previously they would look \u201cfavourably at proposals that ensure a live music component\u201d.", "charCount": "3962", "shouldHideReaderRevenue": "false", "showAffiliateLinks": "false", "bylineHtml": "<a
