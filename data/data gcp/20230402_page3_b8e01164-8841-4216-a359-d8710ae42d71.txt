Ellen E Jones Film choice Pete\u2019s Dragon, 3pm, BBC One\nBefore he unleashes his version of Peter Pan on the world, here\u2019s David Lowery\u2019s entertaining take on another much-loved Disney character. When his parents die in a car crash while the family are driving through a forest, Pete (Oakes Fegley) survives and is befriended by a green dragon he names Elliot. Six years later, the now-feral child is found and taken to a logging town by Bryce Dallas Howard\u2019s kindly ranger. It\u2019s an adventure with King Kong vibes and a strong ecological message, as Elliot \u2013 and the trees he hides in \u2013 come under threat.

Preparations for the ex-president\u2019s arraignment at Manhattan\u2019s criminal courthouse at 100 Centre St have been under way for 10 days, with barriers being erected for crowd control. Indictments and criminal trials scheduled for Tuesday at the same courthouse include: burglary for taking paintings from a West Village townhouse; a thwarted terrorist attack on a Jewish community; the illegal selling of firearms; murder for an East Harlem hammer attack; murder and attempted murder for attacking multiple homeless men; murder and criminal possession of a weapon for shooting into a car in East Harlem; and a grand larceny case involving sim-card swapping. New York police have issued a memo instructing all officers to wear their uniforms and prepare for mobilization, according to local news reports.

A broader problem Traffickers force thousands of people from across Asia to work in online scam centres in a number of countries across the region, including Cambodia, Malaysia and Myanmar. Many victims are kept in old, empty casinos, surrounded by guards and run by crime syndicates that have links to the Cambodian elite, according to extensive reporting from local outlets such as VOD and Al Jazeera. And the practice is on the rise. In August last year the US released its annual trafficking in-person report \u2013 Cambodia was downgraded to the worst level possible. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads After Vitit Muntarbhorn, the UN special rapporteur, visited the country for 11 days on a special mission, he said thousands of people had been trafficked into the country to work as scammers. \u201cCountries are now waking up to the phenomenon and Cambodia needs to activate countermeasures more strongly, while welcoming international cooperation and support,\u201d he said. Dan Halpin, the founder of private cybersecurity firm Cybertrace, says there is a noticeable increase in scams coming out of south-east Asia in comparison to traditional locations like Nigeria. He says the methods used by traffickers to ensnare people are similar to those Rahim experienced. \u201cThe most common method currently appears to be a false promise of employment with an attractive wage, usually advertised through social media or messaging apps,\u201d he says. The victim will often travel overseas, being picked up at the airport by their \u201cemployers\u201d, before having their documents and devices confiscated, he says. \u201cWorkers who are uncooperative have reported experiencing severe physical abuse and are often sold from one scam operation to another. \u201cIt\u2019s very common for victims of scams to be furious at those who have tricked them, not realising that their \u2018scammer\u2019 could also be a victim of an unmerciful multibillion-dollar industry.\u201d \u2018We\u2019re worried about the scale of it\u2019 As the trafficking increases, so does the cost of scams in Australia, with Scamwatch data showing over A$1m has been lost each day this year and a Australian Bureau of Statistics report into personal fraud showing that 65% of people received a scam offer or request in 2021-22, up from 55% in the previous year. The Australian federal police have been working with counterparts across south-east Asia and are currently leading the development and delivery of the Cyber Safety Asia program, which provides cybercrime investigations training to law enforcement personnel across south-east Asia. \u201cIntelligence reveals that there [are] increased incidents of forced criminality of workers being trafficked to run online scams with links to serious transnational criminal networks,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe AFP remains committed to working collaboratively with our south-east Asia partners on matters of joint interest and on targets impacting upon both countries, including combatting cybercrime.\u201d Steve Baird, IJM Australia\u2019s chief executive officer, says the prosecution of the three Indonesian nationals this month sends a strong message. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the first convictions we\u2019re aware of, so for [the main] perpetrator \u2013 who pulled Rahim in \u2013 to actually get a four-year sentence, it starts to send the message that you can\u2019t simply get away with this,\u201d Baird says. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s impunity and they think they can get away with it, they will. So we need more and more of these convictions to really slow the whole thing down and set a precedent. \u201cWe\u2019re worried about the scale of it. We know there are tens of thousands of people in the scamming centres. In the Australian context, you only need to chat to your family and friends to see just the prevalence of scams.\u201d Rahim is now back with his family in Indonesia and has a job delivering water from home to home in his village on the island. He is trying to make life easier for his children. \u201cI hope I\u2019ll get a better job, I will work hard for my children,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope to send them to school. \u201cI am thankful because many parties helped me so I can be released from such a situation.

And the practice is on the rise. In August last year the US released its annual trafficking in-person report \u2013 Cambodia was downgraded to the worst level possible. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads After Vitit Muntarbhorn, the UN special rapporteur, visited the country for 11 days on a special mission, he said thousands of people had been trafficked into the country to work as scammers. \u201cCountries are now waking up to the phenomenon and Cambodia needs to activate countermeasures more strongly, while welcoming international cooperation and support,\u201d he said. Dan Halpin, the founder of private cybersecurity firm Cybertrace, says there is a noticeable increase in scams coming out of south-east Asia in comparison to traditional locations like Nigeria.\nHe says the methods used by traffickers to ensnare people are similar to those Rahim experienced. \u201cThe most common method currently appears to be a false promise of employment with an attractive wage, usually advertised through social media or messaging apps,\u201d he says. The victim will often travel overseas, being picked up at the airport by their \u201cemployers\u201d, before having their documents and devices confiscated, he says. \u201cWorkers who are uncooperative have reported experiencing severe physical abuse and are often sold from one scam operation to another. \u201cIt\u2019s very common for victims of scams to be furious at those who have tricked them, not realising that their \u2018scammer\u2019 could also be a victim of an unmerciful multibillion-dollar industry.\u201d\n\u2018We\u2019re worried about the scale of it\u2019 As the trafficking increases, so does the cost of scams in Australia, with Scamwatch data showing over A$1m has been lost each day this year and a Australian Bureau of Statistics report into personal fraud showing that 65% of people received a scam offer or request in 2021-22, up from 55% in the previous year. The Australian federal police have been working with counterparts across south-east Asia and are currently leading the development and delivery of the Cyber Safety Asia program, which provides cybercrime investigations training to law enforcement personnel across south-east Asia. \u201cIntelligence reveals that there [are] increased incidents of forced criminality of workers being trafficked to run online scams with links to serious transnational criminal networks,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe AFP remains committed to working collaboratively with our south-east Asia partners on matters of joint interest and on targets impacting upon both countries, including combatting cybercrime.\u201d Steve Baird, IJM Australia\u2019s chief executive officer, says the prosecution of the three Indonesian nationals this month sends a strong message. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the first convictions we\u2019re aware of, so for [the main] perpetrator \u2013 who pulled Rahim in \u2013 to actually get a four-year sentence, it starts to send the message that you can\u2019t simply get away with this,\u201d Baird says. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s impunity and they think they can get away with it, they will. So we need more and more of these convictions to really slow the whole thing down and set a precedent. \u201cWe\u2019re worried about the scale of it. We know there are tens of thousands of people in the scamming centres. In the Australian context, you only need to chat to your family and friends to see just the prevalence of scams.\u201d Rahim is now back with his family in Indonesia and has a job delivering water from home to home in his village on the island. He is trying to make life easier for his children. \u201cI hope I\u2019ll get a better job, I will work hard for my children,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope to send them to school. \u201cI am thankful because many parties helped me so I can be released from such a situation.
