Houghton Hall near King\u2019s Lynn, which was built for Robert Walpole in the 1720s, is no stuffy stately home. Its parkland is a treasure trove of modern sculpture by Rachel Whiteread, Anish Kapoor, Henry Moore and more. Some large-scale pieces are in full view, but many others are hidden. Armed with a numbered map, visitors search mazes, walled gardens and woods to track down the artworks \u2013 so it\u2019s great fun for kids, too. The first sculpture to be commissioned, one of James Turrell\u2019s Skyspaces, created in 2000, is still one of the most impressive, while Jeppe Hein\u2019s Waterflame is mesmerising. This year, Sean Scully has a sculpture exhibition in the grounds, plus paintings in the house and the Contemporary Gallery (23 April-29 October, adult from \u00a320/under-18s free).

Still, there were telling details in among the bluster. Here are some of them.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The committee\u2019s approach</p> <p><strong>Bernard Jenkin</strong>:<em> \u201cSo there can be no doubt that you understood what the guidance and rules meant and were intended to achieve \u2013 yes or no?\u201d</em></p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>: <em>\u201cYes.\u201d</em></p> <p>Most of the time, select committees ask open-ended questions designed to reveal the full scope of an issue (and, we might cynically think, to allow MPs time to grandstand). The intention, at least, was different here. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial to understand that this process has followed a pseudo-legal framework,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cThey tried to put him on the spot with closed questions that had to be answered. It did feel as if they were trying to use the session to interrogate specific points of his evidence.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s approach</p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>:<em> \u201cI don\u2019t remember people being four or five deep, I don\u2019t remember saying that, but I will say -\u201d</em></p> <p><strong>Bernard Jenkin</strong>:<em> \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re giving very long answers \u2026 You\u2019re repeating yourself quite a lot.\u201d</em></p> <p>Whatever the committee intended, Johnson had different ideas \u2013 and while he was forced to give direct answers reasonably often, he worked very hard to generalise from narrow questions and return to the safer territory of his talking points: Downing Street was a difficult environment, the guidance was followed and everything he told parliament was what he believed to be true at the time. (Aubrey Allegretti <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/22/boris-johnson-had-a-lot-to-say-about-partygate-but-did-any-of-it-stack-up\">has a fact-check</a> on his evidence.)</p> <p>That might not be terribly persuasive to the committee, and it probably wouldn\u2019t work in a courtroom. \u201cBut you have to think about the wider position he\u2019s in,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cWhat the committee is going to do is reach a view and then, if it\u2019s against Johnson, recommend a sanction that parliament votes on. This is a political process. It is less an inquiry about whether he committed contempt, and more a sentencing hearing that will ultimately be decided by MPs.\u201d</p> <p>It is still eminently possible that even a majority of his own party will vote against Johnson \u2013 but winning in the court of Conservative opinion remains the most plausible strategy he has.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The guidance</p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>:<em> \u201cI\u2019m saying we followed the guidance completely \u2026 It meant that we were following the guidance to the best of our ability, which is what the guidance provided for.\u201d</em></p> <p>Get your head round that: you can follow the guidance in full by following it in part. Having said that he now accepts that the guidance was broken, Johnson expended considerable energy in insisting that in just about every case, it actually wasn\u2019t. This forced him into the unhappy position of claiming that if asked at a No 10 press conference, he would have said that businesses could decide for themselves whether to hold leaving drinks without full social distancing.</p> <p>In general, this was where he appeared most uncomfortable. At one point, when asked about social distancing mitigations during the gatherings, he referred to \u201cscreens or barriers in \u2026 the adjacent press room\u201d. He also said that \u201cwe didn\u2019t touch each other\u2019s pens \u2026 we didn\u2019t pass stuff to each other if we could possibly avoid it.\u201d Not unreasonably, committee chair Harriet Harman suggested that they did appear to have passed drinks.</p> <p>Again and again, Johnson emphasised his role as motivator-in-chief, bound to hold leaving dos to keep the staff from going bananas. I began to see him as Downing Street\u2019s equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exORl6CLB5M\">Bez from the Happy Mondays</a> (Boz?), a hype man shambling merrily from room to room, following guidance and disseminating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/22/vibes-definition-slang-language-meaning\">vibes</a> at all times. </p> <p>\u201cThe sad thing is that in a way he\u2019s right \u2013 people were working incredibly hard, it is an important point about team building,\u201d said Haddon. \u201cBut the counterpoint is also true. That didn\u2019t apply in the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The role of advisers</p> <p><strong>Harriet Harman</strong>:<em> \u201cIf I was going at 100mph and I saw the </em><em>speedo</em><em>meter saying 100mph, it would be a bit odd, wouldn\u2019t it, if I said that somebody assured me that I wasn\u2019t?\u201d</em></p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>: <em>\u201cIs it good enough to rely on the director of communications and the former director of communications \u2026 I think the answer is yes.\u201d</em></p> <p>Johnson argued that he was entitled to count on the advice of his advisers when formulating his responses to MPs\u2019 questions. But the committee raised difficult points about his reliance on that advice, most sharply framed by Harman\u2019s motorway metaphor. They asked why he felt that a line designed to deal with a press inquiry was appropriate for the House of Commons, and noted that he had relied on political appointees with responsibility for communications above senior civil servants and lawyers.</p> <p>\u201cIf you talk to people who\u2019ve been in No 10 during these situations, they will tell you that when a story breaks, it would be surprising to come out with a blanket denial when you haven\u2019t had the chance to look into it,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cHe\u2019s almost blaming his advisers. But as the prime minister, you can\u2019t really outsource responsibility in that way.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The fairness of the process</p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>: <em>\u201cIf this committee were to find me in contempt of parliament \u2026 I think that would not only be unfair, it would be </em><em>wrong\u2026</em><em>\u201d</em></p> <p><strong>Alberto Costa</strong>: <em>\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t categorise it as a witch-hunt or a kangaroo court?\u201d</em></p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>:<em> \u201cI wait to see how you proceed with the evidence that you have.\u201d</em></p> <p>While the comparisons with Trump can feel a bit overdone, this had definite shades of orange about it: he\u2019ll totally accept the outcome, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/20/politics/donald-trump-i-will-totally-accept-election-results-if-i-win/index.html\">if he wins</a>. That sat with a broader impression that Johnson was nursing a sense of grievance, as when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Haggis_UK/status/1638590186597621772\">he lost his temper</a> while accusing Jenkin of talking \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d. (In general, you felt, he was lucky he wasn\u2019t on trial for contempt of Bernard Jenkin.)</p> <p>\u201cWhen a minister appears before a select committee, they\u2019re there on behalf of their departments,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cThis is different \u2013 it\u2019s personal. So maybe it\u2019s not surprising. It could mean his downfall.\u201d</p> <p>Is that more likely this morning than it was yesterday? It\u2019s not clear. The Guardian\u2019s politics live blogger Andrew Sparrow was among those suggesting that the hearing pointed to a finding of \u201crecklessness\u201d rather than deliberate lying, which means the committee might stop short of a sanction that could force a byelection; but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NadineDorries/status/1638592640642949138?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1638592640642949138%7Ctwgr%5Edfd4663aca4cb222535efbd1a7f7498219489bed%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2023%2Fmar%2F22%2Fboris-johnson-partygate-inquiry-privileges-committee-brexit-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-latest-news%3Fpage%3Dwith3Ablock-641b31958f08d39600285a60\">almost nobody</a> thought Johnson had a good day. Even without a recall petition, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/22/impervious-to-advice-or-rules-johnson-held-up-the-shield-of-stupidity\">John Crace wrote</a>, he may well be \u201csent to roam the world as a washed-up end of the pier entertainer, giving the same over-priced speech to people he doesn\u2019t care about and will never see again.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the finer points of lockdown policy in Downing Street have long felt more like a crucible of broader complaints about Johnson\u2019s conduct than a subject that can sustain the kind of scrutiny to which it has now been subjected, and Haddon struggled to come up with much new that had emerged over the course of the afternoon. Still, she said, that didn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t matter.</p> <p>\u201cThe point is that while the committee works, people need to be able to see that justice is being done in the open,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important \u2013 even if it doesn\u2019t move the dial.\u201d</p> <h2>What else we\u2019ve been reading</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74a557c1fa335e05552eaf1986ffb069ce559f75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74a557c1fa335e05552eaf1986ffb069ce559f75/0_725_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arwa Mahdawi with her first banana.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arwa Mahdawi with her first banana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Arwa Mahdawi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi (above) has never had a banana!

It was Shakespearean, it was his Waterloo, it was the Thick of It, it was practically a renaissance painting. It was a January 6 moment, it was a cup-tie atmosphere, it was a show trial, it was a kangaroo court, it was run by \u201cmarsupials\u201d. It was, Boris Johnson said, his \u201clived experience\u201d. Sometimes, it was quite boring. From 2pm to eighteen minutes past five yesterday, the House of Commons\u2019 privileges committee interrogated the former prime minister about his statements to MPs over Partygate. And if, in truth, long stretches of the evidence felt less like the above hyperbole and more like Old Man Yells at Cloud, it was significant nonetheless \u2013 full of clues about how the committee is handling its task, the real issues it has raised, and how Johnson intends to treat its verdict. \u201cI know that you will point to the photos, and then to the guidance, and what I said, and say that it must have been obvious that the guidance was being breached,\u201d Johnson said at one point. \u201cBut that is simply not true.\u201d The first part of this proposition was proven correct. The committee appeared more sceptical of the second. Today\u2019s newsletter, with Dr Catherine Haddon, an expert in ministerial responsibility and parliamentary oversight at the Institute for Government, explains the most important takeaways. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Brexit | The government\u2019s revised Northern Ireland trade plan has passed by 515 votes to 29, including a rebellion by more than 20 Conservative MPs. Rishi Sunak praised the \u201cincredibly strong support\u201d for his agreement, despite high profile defections from Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Priti Patel. Economy | The Bank of England is under pressure to increase interest rates again today after new figures showed that inflation in the UK has risen to 10.4%. The increase was driven by an 18% surge in the cost of food and drink, the highest rate for 45 years. Read Richard Partington\u2019s analysis of the Bank\u2019s dilemma. France | Emmanuel Macron has insisted he will not back down over raising the French pension age in a combative TV interview ahead of another day of strikes. After five nights of highly charged anti-government protests, Macron said that he was prepared to be unpopular \u201cfor the greater interest of the nation\u201d. Rishi Sunak | Rishi Sunak has made nearly \u00a35m over the past three years thanks mostly to gains from his US investment fund, according to tax details published during Boris Johnson\u2019s appearance before the privileges committee. Sunak paid just over \u00a31m in UK tax over the course of the three years, giving him an effective tax rate of 22%. Donald Trump | The Manhattan grand jury expected to consider criminal charges against Donald Trump over his role in the payment of hush money to Stormy Daniels was abruptly postponed on Wednesday. The reason for the schedule change was not clear, but the jury was on standby to meet on Thursday. In depth: \u2018It is less an inquiry about whether he committed contempt, and more a sentencing hearing\u2019 \u201cThat was pretty exhausting,\u201d said Catherine Haddon, speaking shortly after Harriet Harman brought the committee hearing to a close. \u201cI think my main conclusion is that I\u2019m not sure how much it will have changed anyone\u2019s opinion.\u201d Which is a demoralising thing to hear after sitting through more than three hours of it, frankly \u2013 but there were very few new facts unearthed in the session: the real substance of the committee\u2019s work and Johnson\u2019s response is in documents that have already been made public. Still, there were telling details in among the bluster. Here are some of them. *** The committee\u2019s approach Bernard Jenkin: \u201cSo there can be no doubt that you understood what the guidance and rules meant and were intended to achieve \u2013 yes or no?\u201d Boris Johnson: \u201cYes.\u201d Most of the time, select committees ask open-ended questions designed to reveal the full scope of an issue (and, we might cynically think, to allow MPs time to grandstand). The intention, at least, was different here. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial to understand that this process has followed a pseudo-legal framework,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cThey tried to put him on the spot with closed questions that had to be answered. It did feel as if they were trying to use the session to interrogate specific points of his evidence.\u201d *** Johnson\u2019s approach Boris Johnson: \u201cI don\u2019t remember people being four or five deep, I don\u2019t remember saying that, but I will say -\u201d Bernard Jenkin: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re giving very long answers \u2026 You\u2019re repeating yourself quite a lot.\u201d Whatever the committee intended, Johnson had different ideas \u2013 and while he was forced to give direct answers reasonably often, he worked very hard to generalise from narrow questions and return to the safer territory of his talking points: Downing Street was a difficult environment, the guidance was followed and everything he told parliament was what he believed to be true at the time. (Aubrey Allegretti has a fact-check on his evidence.) That might not be terribly persuasive to the committee, and it probably wouldn\u2019t work in a courtroom. \u201cBut you have to think about the wider position he\u2019s in,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cWhat the committee is going to do is reach a view and then, if it\u2019s against Johnson, recommend a sanction that parliament votes on. This is a political process. It is less an inquiry about whether he committed contempt, and more a sentencing hearing that will ultimately be decided by MPs.\u201d It is still eminently possible that even a majority of his own party will vote against Johnson \u2013 but winning in the court of Conservative opinion remains the most plausible strategy he has. *** The guidance Boris Johnson: \u201cI\u2019m saying we followed the guidance completely \u2026 It meant that we were following the guidance to the best of our ability, which is what the guidance provided for.\u201d Get your head round that: you can follow the guidance in full by following it in part. Having said that he now accepts that the guidance was broken, Johnson expended considerable energy in insisting that in just about every case, it actually wasn\u2019t. This forced him into the unhappy position of claiming that if asked at a No 10 press conference, he would have said that businesses could decide for themselves whether to hold leaving drinks without full social distancing. In general, this was where he appeared most uncomfortable. At one point, when asked about social distancing mitigations during the gatherings, he referred to \u201cscreens or barriers in \u2026 the adjacent press room\u201d. He also said that \u201cwe didn\u2019t touch each other\u2019s pens \u2026 we didn\u2019t pass stuff to each other if we could possibly avoid it.\u201d Not unreasonably, committee chair Harriet Harman suggested that they did appear to have passed drinks. Again and again, Johnson emphasised his role as motivator-in-chief, bound to hold leaving dos to keep the staff from going bananas. I began to see him as Downing Street\u2019s equivalent of Bez from the Happy Mondays (Boz?), a hype man shambling merrily from room to room, following guidance and disseminating vibes at all times. \u201cThe sad thing is that in a way he\u2019s right \u2013 people were working incredibly hard, it is an important point about team building,\u201d said Haddon. \u201cBut the counterpoint is also true. That didn\u2019t apply in the NHS.\u201d *** The role of advisers Harriet Harman: \u201cIf I was going at 100mph and I saw the speedometer saying 100mph, it would be a bit odd, wouldn\u2019t it, if I said that somebody assured me that I wasn\u2019t?\u201d Boris Johnson: \u201cIs it good enough to rely on the director of communications and the former director of communications \u2026 I think the answer is yes.\u201d Johnson argued that he was entitled to count on the advice of his advisers when formulating his responses to MPs\u2019 questions. But the committee raised difficult points about his reliance on that advice, most sharply framed by Harman\u2019s motorway metaphor. They asked why he felt that a line designed to deal with a press inquiry was appropriate for the House of Commons, and noted that he had relied on political appointees with responsibility for communications above senior civil servants and lawyers. \u201cIf you talk to people who\u2019ve been in No 10 during these situations, they will tell you that when a story breaks, it would be surprising to come out with a blanket denial when you haven\u2019t had the chance to look into it,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cHe\u2019s almost blaming his advisers. But as the prime minister, you can\u2019t really outsource responsibility in that way.\u201d *** The fairness of the process Boris Johnson: \u201cIf this committee were to find me in contempt of parliament \u2026 I think that would not only be unfair, it would be wrong\u2026\u201d Alberto Costa: \u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t categorise it as a witch-hunt or a kangaroo court?\u201d Boris Johnson: \u201cI wait to see how you proceed with the evidence that you have.\u201d While the comparisons with Trump can feel a bit overdone, this had definite shades of orange about it: he\u2019ll totally accept the outcome, if he wins. That sat with a broader impression that Johnson was nursing a sense of grievance, as when he lost his temper while accusing Jenkin of talking \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d. (In general, you felt, he was lucky he wasn\u2019t on trial for contempt of Bernard Jenkin.) \u201cWhen a minister appears before a select committee, they\u2019re there on behalf of their departments,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cThis is different \u2013 it\u2019s personal. So maybe it\u2019s not surprising. It could mean his downfall.\u201d Is that more likely this morning than it was yesterday? It\u2019s not clear. The Guardian\u2019s politics live blogger Andrew Sparrow was among those suggesting that the hearing pointed to a finding of \u201crecklessness\u201d rather than deliberate lying, which means the committee might stop short of a sanction that could force a byelection; but almost nobody thought Johnson had a good day. Even without a recall petition, John Crace wrote, he may well be \u201csent to roam the world as a washed-up end of the pier entertainer, giving the same over-priced speech to people he doesn\u2019t care about and will never see again.\u201d Meanwhile, the finer points of lockdown policy in Downing Street have long felt more like a crucible of broader complaints about Johnson\u2019s conduct than a subject that can sustain the kind of scrutiny to which it has now been subjected, and Haddon struggled to come up with much new that had emerged over the course of the afternoon. Still, she said, that didn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cThe point is that while the committee works, people need to be able to see that justice is being done in the open,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important \u2013 even if it doesn\u2019t move the dial.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading Arwa Mahdawi (above) has never had a banana!

It was Shakespearean, it was his Waterloo, it was the Thick of It, it was practically a renaissance painting. It was a January 6 moment, it was a cup-tie atmosphere, it was a show trial, it was a kangaroo court, it was run by \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jacob_Rees_Mogg/status/1638565545690759168\">marsupials</a>\u201d. It was, Boris Johnson said, his \u201clived experience\u201d. Sometimes, it was quite boring.</p> <p>From 2pm to eighteen minutes past five yesterday, the House of Commons\u2019 privileges committee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/22/boris-johnson-facing-formal-reprimand-for-misleading-parliament\">interrogated the former prime minister about his statements to MPs</a> over Partygate. And if, in truth, long stretches of the evidence felt less like the above hyperbole and more like <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/old-man-yells-at-cloud\">Old Man Yells at Cloud</a>, it was significant nonetheless \u2013 full of clues about how the committee is handling its task, the real issues it has raised, and how Johnson intends to treat its verdict. </p> <p>\u201cI know that you will point to the photos, and then to the guidance, and what I said, and say that it must have been obvious that the guidance was being breached,\u201d Johnson said at one point. \u201cBut that is simply not true.\u201d The first part of this proposition was proven correct. The committee appeared more sceptical of the second.</p> <p>Today\u2019s newsletter, with Dr Catherine Haddon, an expert in ministerial responsibility and parliamentary oversight at the Institute for Government, explains the most important takeaways. Here are the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Brexit </strong></em>|<em><strong> </strong></em>The government\u2019s revised Northern Ireland trade plan has passed by 515 votes to 29, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/22/tory-mps-rebel-as-rishi-sunak-northern-ireland-brexit-plan-passes\">a rebellion by more than 20 Conservative MPs</a>. Rishi Sunak praised the \u201cincredibly strong support\u201d for his agreement, despite high profile defections from Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Priti Patel.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Economy </strong></em>|<em><strong> </strong></em>The Bank of England is under pressure to increase interest rates again today after new figures showed that inflation in the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/22/uk-inflation-rate-rises-price-rises-interest-rates\">has risen to 10.4%</a>. The increase was driven by an 18% surge in the cost of food and drink, the highest rate for 45 years. Read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/22/uk-inflation-rise-bank-of-england-interest-rate-economy-recession\">Richard Partington\u2019s analysis</a> of the Bank\u2019s dilemma.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>France</strong></em> | Emmanuel Macron <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/22/emmanuel-macron-says-he-will-not-back-down-over-pension-age-rise-france\">has insisted he will not back down</a> over raising the French pension age in a combative TV interview ahead of another day of strikes. After five nights of highly charged anti-government protests, Macron said that he was prepared to be unpopular \u201cfor the greater interest of the nation\u201d.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Rishi Sunak </strong></em>| Rishi Sunak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/22/rishi-sunak-publishes-long-awaited-personal-uk-tax-returns\">has made nearly \u00a35m over the past three years</a> thanks mostly to gains from his US investment fund, according to tax details published during Boris Johnson\u2019s appearance before the privileges committee. Sunak paid just over \u00a31m in UK tax over the course of the three years, giving him an effective tax rate of 22%.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Donald Trump</strong></em> | The Manhattan grand jury expected to consider criminal charges against Donald Trump over his role in the payment of hush money to Stormy Daniels was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/22/trump-grand-jury-delay-charges-hush-money\">abruptly postponed on Wednesday</a>.

Still, there were telling details in among the bluster. Here are some of them.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The committee\u2019s approach</p> <p><strong>Bernard Jenkin</strong>:<em> \u201cSo there can be no doubt that you understood what the guidance and rules meant and were intended to achieve \u2013 yes or no?\u201d</em></p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>: <em>\u201cYes.\u201d</em></p> <p>Most of the time, select committees ask open-ended questions designed to reveal the full scope of an issue (and, we might cynically think, to allow MPs time to grandstand). The intention, at least, was different here. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial to understand that this process has followed a pseudo-legal framework,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cThey tried to put him on the spot with closed questions that had to be answered. It did feel as if they were trying to use the session to interrogate specific points of his evidence.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s approach</p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>:<em> \u201cI don\u2019t remember people being four or five deep, I don\u2019t remember saying that, but I will say -\u201d</em></p> <p><strong>Bernard Jenkin</strong>:<em> \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re giving very long answers \u2026 You\u2019re repeating yourself quite a lot.\u201d</em></p> <p>Whatever the committee intended, Johnson had different ideas \u2013 and while he was forced to give direct answers reasonably often, he worked very hard to generalise from narrow questions and return to the safer territory of his talking points: Downing Street was a difficult environment, the guidance was followed and everything he told parliament was what he believed to be true at the time. (Aubrey Allegretti <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/22/boris-johnson-had-a-lot-to-say-about-partygate-but-did-any-of-it-stack-up\">has a fact-check</a> on his evidence.)</p> <p>That might not be terribly persuasive to the committee, and it probably wouldn\u2019t work in a courtroom. \u201cBut you have to think about the wider position he\u2019s in,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cWhat the committee is going to do is reach a view and then, if it\u2019s against Johnson, recommend a sanction that parliament votes on. This is a political process. It is less an inquiry about whether he committed contempt, and more a sentencing hearing that will ultimately be decided by MPs.\u201d</p> <p>It is still eminently possible that even a majority of his own party will vote against Johnson \u2013 but winning in the court of Conservative opinion remains the most plausible strategy he has.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The guidance</p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>:<em> \u201cI\u2019m saying we followed the guidance completely \u2026 It meant that we were following the guidance to the best of our ability, which is what the guidance provided for.\u201d</em></p> <p>Get your head round that: you can follow the guidance in full by following it in part. Having said that he now accepts that the guidance was broken, Johnson expended considerable energy in insisting that in just about every case, it actually wasn\u2019t. This forced him into the unhappy position of claiming that if asked at a No 10 press conference, he would have said that businesses could decide for themselves whether to hold leaving drinks without full social distancing.</p> <p>In general, this was where he appeared most uncomfortable. At one point, when asked about social distancing mitigations during the gatherings, he referred to \u201cscreens or barriers in \u2026 the adjacent press room\u201d. He also said that \u201cwe didn\u2019t touch each other\u2019s pens \u2026 we didn\u2019t pass stuff to each other if we could possibly avoid it.\u201d Not unreasonably, committee chair Harriet Harman suggested that they did appear to have passed drinks.</p> <p>Again and again, Johnson emphasised his role as motivator-in-chief, bound to hold leaving dos to keep the staff from going bananas. I began to see him as Downing Street\u2019s equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exORl6CLB5M\">Bez from the Happy Mondays</a> (Boz?), a hype man shambling merrily from room to room, following guidance and disseminating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/22/vibes-definition-slang-language-meaning\">vibes</a> at all times. </p> <p>\u201cThe sad thing is that in a way he\u2019s right \u2013 people were working incredibly hard, it is an important point about team building,\u201d said Haddon. \u201cBut the counterpoint is also true. That didn\u2019t apply in the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The role of advisers</p> <p><strong>Harriet Harman</strong>:<em> \u201cIf I was going at 100mph and I saw the </em><em>speedo</em><em>meter saying 100mph, it would be a bit odd, wouldn\u2019t it, if I said that somebody assured me that I wasn\u2019t?\u201d</em></p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>: <em>\u201cIs it good enough to rely on the director of communications and the former director of communications \u2026 I think the answer is yes.\u201d</em></p> <p>Johnson argued that he was entitled to count on the advice of his advisers when formulating his responses to MPs\u2019 questions. But the committee raised difficult points about his reliance on that advice, most sharply framed by Harman\u2019s motorway metaphor. They asked why he felt that a line designed to deal with a press inquiry was appropriate for the House of Commons, and noted that he had relied on political appointees with responsibility for communications above senior civil servants and lawyers.</p> <p>\u201cIf you talk to people who\u2019ve been in No 10 during these situations, they will tell you that when a story breaks, it would be surprising to come out with a blanket denial when you haven\u2019t had the chance to look into it,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cHe\u2019s almost blaming his advisers. But as the prime minister, you can\u2019t really outsource responsibility in that way.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The fairness of the process</p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>: <em>\u201cIf this committee were to find me in contempt of parliament \u2026 I think that would not only be unfair, it would be </em><em>wrong\u2026</em><em>\u201d</em></p> <p><strong>Alberto Costa</strong>: <em>\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t categorise it as a witch-hunt or a kangaroo court?\u201d</em></p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>:<em> \u201cI wait to see how you proceed with the evidence that you have.\u201d</em></p> <p>While the comparisons with Trump can feel a bit overdone, this had definite shades of orange about it: he\u2019ll totally accept the outcome, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/20/politics/donald-trump-i-will-totally-accept-election-results-if-i-win/index.html\">if he wins</a>. That sat with a broader impression that Johnson was nursing a sense of grievance, as when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Haggis_UK/status/1638590186597621772\">he lost his temper</a> while accusing Jenkin of talking \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d. (In general, you felt, he was lucky he wasn\u2019t on trial for contempt of Bernard Jenkin.)</p> <p>\u201cWhen a minister appears before a select committee, they\u2019re there on behalf of their departments,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cThis is different \u2013 it\u2019s personal. So maybe it\u2019s not surprising. It could mean his downfall.\u201d</p> <p>Is that more likely this morning than it was yesterday? It\u2019s not clear. The Guardian\u2019s politics live blogger Andrew Sparrow was among those suggesting that the hearing pointed to a finding of \u201crecklessness\u201d rather than deliberate lying, which means the committee might stop short of a sanction that could force a byelection; but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NadineDorries/status/1638592640642949138?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1638592640642949138%7Ctwgr%5Edfd4663aca4cb222535efbd1a7f7498219489bed%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2023%2Fmar%2F22%2Fboris-johnson-partygate-inquiry-privileges-committee-brexit-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-latest-news%3Fpage%3Dwith3Ablock-641b31958f08d39600285a60\">almost nobody</a> thought Johnson had a good day. Even without a recall petition, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/22/impervious-to-advice-or-rules-johnson-held-up-the-shield-of-stupidity\">John Crace wrote</a>, he may well be \u201csent to roam the world as a washed-up end of the pier entertainer, giving the same over-priced speech to people he doesn\u2019t care about and will never see again.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the finer points of lockdown policy in Downing Street have long felt more like a crucible of broader complaints about Johnson\u2019s conduct than a subject that can sustain the kind of scrutiny to which it has now been subjected, and Haddon struggled to come up with much new that had emerged over the course of the afternoon.

It was Shakespearean, it was his Waterloo, it was the Thick of It, it was practically a renaissance painting. It was a January 6 moment, it was a cup-tie atmosphere, it was a show trial, it was a kangaroo court, it was run by \u201cmarsupials\u201d. It was, Boris Johnson said, his \u201clived experience\u201d. Sometimes, it was quite boring. From 2pm to eighteen minutes past five yesterday, the House of Commons\u2019 privileges committee interrogated the former prime minister about his statements to MPs over Partygate. And if, in truth, long stretches of the evidence felt less like the above hyperbole and more like Old Man Yells at Cloud, it was significant nonetheless \u2013 full of clues about how the committee is handling its task, the real issues it has raised, and how Johnson intends to treat its verdict. \u201cI know that you will point to the photos, and then to the guidance, and what I said, and say that it must have been obvious that the guidance was being breached,\u201d Johnson said at one point. \u201cBut that is simply not true.\u201d The first part of this proposition was proven correct. The committee appeared more sceptical of the second. Today\u2019s newsletter, with Dr Catherine Haddon, an expert in ministerial responsibility and parliamentary oversight at the Institute for Government, explains the most important takeaways. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Brexit | The government\u2019s revised Northern Ireland trade plan has passed by 515 votes to 29, including a rebellion by more than 20 Conservative MPs. Rishi Sunak praised the \u201cincredibly strong support\u201d for his agreement, despite high profile defections from Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Priti Patel. Economy | The Bank of England is under pressure to increase interest rates again today after new figures showed that inflation in the UK has risen to 10.4%. The increase was driven by an 18% surge in the cost of food and drink, the highest rate for 45 years. Read Richard Partington\u2019s analysis of the Bank\u2019s dilemma. France | Emmanuel Macron has insisted he will not back down over raising the French pension age in a combative TV interview ahead of another day of strikes. After five nights of highly charged anti-government protests, Macron said that he was prepared to be unpopular \u201cfor the greater interest of the nation\u201d. Rishi Sunak | Rishi Sunak has made nearly \u00a35m over the past three years thanks mostly to gains from his US investment fund, according to tax details published during Boris Johnson\u2019s appearance before the privileges committee. Sunak paid just over \u00a31m in UK tax over the course of the three years, giving him an effective tax rate of 22%. Donald Trump | The Manhattan grand jury expected to consider criminal charges against Donald Trump over his role in the payment of hush money to Stormy Daniels was abruptly postponed on Wednesday. The reason for the schedule change was not clear, but the jury was on standby to meet on Thursday. In depth: \u2018It is less an inquiry about whether he committed contempt, and more a sentencing hearing\u2019\n\u201cThat was pretty exhausting,\u201d said Catherine Haddon, speaking shortly after Harriet Harman brought the committee hearing to a close. \u201cI think my main conclusion is that I\u2019m not sure how much it will have changed anyone\u2019s opinion.\u201d Which is a demoralising thing to hear after sitting through more than three hours of it, frankly \u2013 but there were very few new facts unearthed in the session: the real substance of the committee\u2019s work and Johnson\u2019s response is in documents that have already been made public. Still, there were telling details in among the bluster. Here are some of them. *** The committee\u2019s approach Bernard Jenkin: \u201cSo there can be no doubt that you understood what the guidance and rules meant and were intended to achieve \u2013 yes or no?\u201d Boris Johnson: \u201cYes.\u201d Most of the time, select committees ask open-ended questions designed to reveal the full scope of an issue (and, we might cynically think, to allow MPs time to grandstand). The intention, at least, was different here. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial to understand that this process has followed a pseudo-legal framework,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cThey tried to put him on the spot with closed questions that had to be answered. It did feel as if they were trying to use the session to interrogate specific points of his evidence.\u201d *** Johnson\u2019s approach Boris Johnson: \u201cI don\u2019t remember people being four or five deep, I don\u2019t remember saying that, but I will say -\u201d Bernard Jenkin: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re giving very long answers \u2026 You\u2019re repeating yourself quite a lot.\u201d Whatever the committee intended, Johnson had different ideas \u2013 and while he was forced to give direct answers reasonably often, he worked very hard to generalise from narrow questions and return to the safer territory of his talking points: Downing Street was a difficult environment, the guidance was followed and everything he told parliament was what he believed to be true at the time. (Aubrey Allegretti has a fact-check on his evidence.) That might not be terribly persuasive to the committee, and it probably wouldn\u2019t work in a courtroom. \u201cBut you have to think about the wider position he\u2019s in,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cWhat the committee is going to do is reach a view and then, if it\u2019s against Johnson, recommend a sanction that parliament votes on. This is a political process. It is less an inquiry about whether he committed contempt, and more a sentencing hearing that will ultimately be decided by MPs.\u201d It is still eminently possible that even a majority of his own party will vote against Johnson \u2013 but winning in the court of Conservative opinion remains the most plausible strategy he has. *** The guidance Boris Johnson: \u201cI\u2019m saying we followed the guidance completely \u2026 It meant that we were following the guidance to the best of our ability, which is what the guidance provided for.\u201d Get your head round that: you can follow the guidance in full by following it in part. Having said that he now accepts that the guidance was broken, Johnson expended considerable energy in insisting that in just about every case, it actually wasn\u2019t. This forced him into the unhappy position of claiming that if asked at a No 10 press conference, he would have said that businesses could decide for themselves whether to hold leaving drinks without full social distancing. In general, this was where he appeared most uncomfortable. At one point, when asked about social distancing mitigations during the gatherings, he referred to \u201cscreens or barriers in \u2026 the adjacent press room\u201d. He also said that \u201cwe didn\u2019t touch each other\u2019s pens \u2026 we didn\u2019t pass stuff to each other if we could possibly avoid it.\u201d Not unreasonably, committee chair Harriet Harman suggested that they did appear to have passed drinks. Again and again, Johnson emphasised his role as motivator-in-chief, bound to hold leaving dos to keep the staff from going bananas. I began to see him as Downing Street\u2019s equivalent of Bez from the Happy Mondays (Boz?), a hype man shambling merrily from room to room, following guidance and disseminating vibes at all times. \u201cThe sad thing is that in a way he\u2019s right \u2013 people were working incredibly hard, it is an important point about team building,\u201d said Haddon. \u201cBut the counterpoint is also true. That didn\u2019t apply in the NHS.\u201d *** The role of advisers Harriet Harman: \u201cIf I was going at 100mph and I saw the speedometer saying 100mph, it would be a bit odd, wouldn\u2019t it, if I said that somebody assured me that I wasn\u2019t?\u201d Boris Johnson: \u201cIs it good enough to rely on the director of communications and the former director of communications \u2026 I think the answer is yes.\u201d Johnson argued that he was entitled to count on the advice of his advisers when formulating his responses to MPs\u2019 questions. But the committee raised difficult points about his reliance on that advice, most sharply framed by Harman\u2019s motorway metaphor. They asked why he felt that a line designed to deal with a press inquiry was appropriate for the House of Commons, and noted that he had relied on political appointees with responsibility for communications above senior civil servants and lawyers. \u201cIf you talk to people who\u2019ve been in No 10 during these situations, they will tell you that when a story breaks, it would be surprising to come out with a blanket denial when you haven\u2019t had the chance to look into it,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cHe\u2019s almost blaming his advisers. But as the prime minister, you can\u2019t really outsource responsibility in that way.\u201d *** The fairness of the process Boris Johnson: \u201cIf this committee were to find me in contempt of parliament \u2026 I think that would not only be unfair, it would be wrong\u2026\u201d Alberto Costa: \u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t categorise it as a witch-hunt or a kangaroo court?\u201d Boris Johnson: \u201cI wait to see how you proceed with the evidence that you have.\u201d While the comparisons with Trump can feel a bit overdone, this had definite shades of orange about it: he\u2019ll totally accept the outcome, if he wins. That sat with a broader impression that Johnson was nursing a sense of grievance, as when he lost his temper while accusing Jenkin of talking \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d. (In general, you felt, he was lucky he wasn\u2019t on trial for contempt of Bernard Jenkin.) \u201cWhen a minister appears before a select committee, they\u2019re there on behalf of their departments,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cThis is different \u2013 it\u2019s personal. So maybe it\u2019s not surprising. It could mean his downfall.\u201d Is that more likely this morning than it was yesterday? It\u2019s not clear. The Guardian\u2019s politics live blogger Andrew Sparrow was among those suggesting that the hearing pointed to a finding of \u201crecklessness\u201d rather than deliberate lying, which means the committee might stop short of a sanction that could force a byelection; but almost nobody thought Johnson had a good day. Even without a recall petition, John Crace wrote, he may well be \u201csent to roam the world as a washed-up end of the pier entertainer, giving the same over-priced speech to people he doesn\u2019t care about and will never see again.\u201d Meanwhile, the finer points of lockdown policy in Downing Street have long felt more like a crucible of broader complaints about Johnson\u2019s conduct than a subject that can sustain the kind of scrutiny to which it has now been subjected, and Haddon struggled to come up with much new that had emerged over the course of the afternoon. Still, she said, that didn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cThe point is that while the committee works, people need to be able to see that justice is being done in the open,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important \u2013 even if it doesn\u2019t move the dial.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading\nArwa Mahdawi (above) has never had a banana!

Still, there were telling details in among the bluster. Here are some of them.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>The committee\u2019s approach</p> \n<p><strong>Bernard Jenkin</strong>:<em> \u201cSo there can be no doubt that you understood what the guidance and rules meant and were intended to achieve \u2013 yes or no?\u201d</em></p> \n<p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>: <em>\u201cYes.\u201d</em></p> \n<p>Most of the time, select committees ask open-ended questions designed to reveal the full scope of an issue (and, we might cynically think, to allow MPs time to grandstand). The intention, at least, was different here. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial to understand that this process has followed a pseudo-legal framework,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cThey tried to put him on the spot with closed questions that had to be answered. It did feel as if they were trying to use the session to interrogate specific points of his evidence.\u201d</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s approach</p> \n<p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>:<em> \u201cI don\u2019t remember people being four or five deep, I don\u2019t remember saying that, but I will say -\u201d</em></p> \n<p><strong>Bernard Jenkin</strong>:<em> \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re giving very long answers \u2026 You\u2019re repeating yourself quite a lot.\u201d</em></p> \n<p>Whatever the committee intended, Johnson had different ideas \u2013 and while he was forced to give direct answers reasonably often, he worked very hard to generalise from narrow questions and return to the safer territory of his talking points: Downing Street was a difficult environment, the guidance was followed and everything he told parliament was what he believed to be true at the time. (Aubrey Allegretti <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/22/boris-johnson-had-a-lot-to-say-about-partygate-but-did-any-of-it-stack-up\">has a fact-check</a> on his evidence.)</p> \n<p>That might not be terribly persuasive to the committee, and it probably wouldn\u2019t work in a courtroom. \u201cBut you have to think about the wider position he\u2019s in,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cWhat the committee is going to do is reach a view and then, if it\u2019s against Johnson, recommend a sanction that parliament votes on. This is a political process. It is less an inquiry about whether he committed contempt, and more a sentencing hearing that will ultimately be decided by MPs.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is still eminently possible that even a majority of his own party will vote against Johnson \u2013 but winning in the court of Conservative opinion remains the most plausible strategy he has.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>The guidance</p> \n<p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>:<em> \u201cI\u2019m saying we followed the guidance completely \u2026 It meant that we were following the guidance to the best of our ability, which is what the guidance provided for.\u201d</em></p> \n<p>Get your head round that: you can follow the guidance in full by following it in part. Having said that he now accepts that the guidance was broken, Johnson expended considerable energy in insisting that in just about every case, it actually wasn\u2019t. This forced him into the unhappy position of claiming that if asked at a No 10 press conference, he would have said that businesses could decide for themselves whether to hold leaving drinks without full social distancing.</p> \n<p>In general, this was where he appeared most uncomfortable. At one point, when asked about social distancing mitigations during the gatherings, he referred to \u201cscreens or barriers in \u2026 the adjacent press room\u201d. He also said that \u201cwe didn\u2019t touch each other\u2019s pens \u2026 we didn\u2019t pass stuff to each other if we could possibly avoid it.\u201d Not unreasonably, committee chair Harriet Harman suggested that they did appear to have passed drinks.</p> \n<p>Again and again, Johnson emphasised his role as motivator-in-chief, bound to hold leaving dos to keep the staff from going bananas. I began to see him as Downing Street\u2019s equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exORl6CLB5M\">Bez from the Happy Mondays</a> (Boz?), a hype man shambling merrily from room to room, following guidance and disseminating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/22/vibes-definition-slang-language-meaning\">vibes</a> at all times. </p> \n<p>\u201cThe sad thing is that in a way he\u2019s right \u2013 people were working incredibly hard, it is an important point about team building,\u201d said Haddon. \u201cBut the counterpoint is also true. That didn\u2019t apply in the NHS.\u201d</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>The role of advisers</p> \n<p><strong>Harriet Harman</strong>:<em> \u201cIf I was going at 100mph and I saw the </em><em>speedo</em><em>meter saying 100mph, it would be a bit odd, wouldn\u2019t it, if I said that somebody assured me that I wasn\u2019t?\u201d</em></p> \n<p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>: <em>\u201cIs it good enough to rely on the director of communications and the former director of communications \u2026 I think the answer is yes.\u201d</em></p> \n<p>Johnson argued that he was entitled to count on the advice of his advisers when formulating his responses to MPs\u2019 questions. But the committee raised difficult points about his reliance on that advice, most sharply framed by Harman\u2019s motorway metaphor. They asked why he felt that a line designed to deal with a press inquiry was appropriate for the House of Commons, and noted that he had relied on political appointees with responsibility for communications above senior civil servants and lawyers.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you talk to people who\u2019ve been in No 10 during these situations, they will tell you that when a story breaks, it would be surprising to come out with a blanket denial when you haven\u2019t had the chance to look into it,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cHe\u2019s almost blaming his advisers. But as the prime minister, you can\u2019t really outsource responsibility in that way.\u201d</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>The fairness of the process</p> \n<p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>: <em>\u201cIf this committee were to find me in contempt of parliament \u2026 I think that would not only be unfair, it would be </em><em>wrong\u2026</em><em>\u201d</em></p> \n<p><strong>Alberto Costa</strong>: <em>\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t categorise it as a witch-hunt or a kangaroo court?\u201d</em></p> \n<p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong>:<em> \u201cI wait to see how you proceed with the evidence that you have.\u201d</em></p> \n<p>While the comparisons with Trump can feel a bit overdone, this had definite shades of orange about it: he\u2019ll totally accept the outcome, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/20/politics/donald-trump-i-will-totally-accept-election-results-if-i-win/index.html\">if he wins</a>. That sat with a broader impression that Johnson was nursing a sense of grievance, as when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Haggis_UK/status/1638590186597621772\">he lost his temper</a> while accusing Jenkin of talking \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d. (In general, you felt, he was lucky he wasn\u2019t on trial for contempt of Bernard Jenkin.)</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen a minister appears before a select committee, they\u2019re there on behalf of their departments,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cThis is different \u2013 it\u2019s personal. So maybe it\u2019s not surprising. It could mean his downfall.\u201d</p> \n<p>Is that more likely this morning than it was yesterday? It\u2019s not clear. The Guardian\u2019s politics live blogger Andrew Sparrow was among those suggesting that the hearing pointed to a finding of \u201crecklessness\u201d rather than deliberate lying, which means the committee might stop short of a sanction that could force a byelection; but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NadineDorries/status/1638592640642949138?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1638592640642949138%7Ctwgr%5Edfd4663aca4cb222535efbd1a7f7498219489bed%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2023%2Fmar%2F22%2Fboris-johnson-partygate-inquiry-privileges-committee-brexit-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-latest-news%3Fpage%3Dwith3Ablock-641b31958f08d39600285a60\">almost nobody</a> thought Johnson had a good day.

Still, she said, that didn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t matter.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe point is that while the committee works, people need to be able to see that justice is being done in the open,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important \u2013 even if it doesn\u2019t move the dial.\u201d</p> \n<h2>What else we\u2019ve been reading</h2>"}}, {"type": "image", "assets": [{"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/74a557c1fa335e05552eaf1986ffb069ce559f75/0_725_3024_1814/3024.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 3024, "height": 1814}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/74a557c1fa335e05552eaf1986ffb069ce559f75/0_725_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 3024, "height": 1814, "isMaster": true}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/74a557c1fa335e05552eaf1986ffb069ce559f75/0_725_3024_1814/2000.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 2000, "height": 1200}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/74a557c1fa335e05552eaf1986ffb069ce559f75/0_725_3024_1814/1000.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 1000, "height": 600}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/74a557c1fa335e05552eaf1986ffb069ce559f75/0_725_3024_1814/500.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 500, "height": 300}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/74a557c1fa335e05552eaf1986ffb069ce559f75/0_725_3024_1814/140.jpg", "typeData": {"aspectRatio": "5:3", "width": 140, "height": 84}}], "imageTypeData": {"caption": "Arwa Mahdawi with her first banana.", "displayCredit": false, "credit": "Photograph: Courtesy of Arwa Mahdawi", "source": "Courtesy of Arwa Mahdawi", "alt": "Arwa Mahdawi with her first banana.", "mediaId": "74a557c1fa335e05552eaf1986ffb069ce559f75", "mediaApiUri": "https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/74a557c1fa335e05552eaf1986ffb069ce559f75", "imageType": "Photograph"}}, {"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<ul> \n <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi (above) has never had a banana!

Lehrmann is trying to convince the federal court to give him an extension to the usual 12-month time limit on bringing defamation claims, blaming the delay on the criminal proceedings, prior legal advice to not immediately pursue defamation proceedings and his mental health. On Thursday, the court had expected to hear evidence from Lehrmann\u2019s former lawyer, Warwick Korn, about the advice he gave his then client after News Corp and Network Ten first published Brittany Higgins\u2019 allegations of rape on 15 February 2021. Lehrmann said Korn told him to wait until criminal proceedings were over before filing a defamation claim. Korn, however, was not called to give evidence on Thursday, a change described as \u201cremarkable\u201d by Network Ten\u2019s lawyers. Lehrmann and the media outlets instead made their final arguments to Justice Michael Lee on whether the 12-month time limit should be extended. Matthew Collins KC, representing Network Ten, said it was clearly not reasonable for Lehrmann to fail to file the defamation claim within one year. Collins said a series of text messages to his then girlfriend and friends, sent from Korn\u2019s office on the day of the initial publications in News Corp and Network Ten, show he had been advised not to worry about a criminal prosecution and told he could make millions of dollars in a defamation claim. \u201cIf I\u2019m named tonight, he says I\u2019m up for millions as defamation,\u201d Lehrmann told his then girlfriend in one message.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup To not file a defamation claim in such circumstances, Collins said, was clearly not reasonable. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a plaintiff who says I\u2019m primarily focused on my reputation, I\u2019ve been told there won\u2019t be a prosecution, I\u2019m exploring getting a PR agent, I\u2019m exploring talking to the media \u2026 yet doesn\u2019t send a concerns notice, doesn\u2019t even put the defendants on notice of a claim,\u201d Collins told the court. Lehrmann has since said he never received any such legal advice. He says the texts were fabrications, designed to put on a \u201cbrave face\u201d and reassure his then girlfriend and friends. Collins said Lehrmann\u2019s claims about fabricating the texts were \u201cinherently unbelievable\u201d. Earlier, Matthew Richardson SC, representing Lehrmann, argued that the criminal charges laid against his client in August 2021, and the prospect of those charges, meant that Lehrmann would have been \u201cexposed to prejudice\u201d had he brought defamation action within the usual one-year time limit. Richardson said that risk of prejudice is reason enough for Lehrmann not to have brought a defamation claim within 12 months. If Lehrmann had brought defamation claims, it may have required him to give evidence in civil proceedings prior to any criminal trial, compromising his right to silence, Richardson said. \u201cOur position is that commencing civil litigation on almost entirely the same issues would have exposed him to prejudice,\u201d he said. But both Network Ten and Wilkinson rejected that he could have been exposed to prejudice. Sue Chrysanthou SC, representing Wilkinson, questioned why Lehrmann had not even sent a letter of demand or concerns notice to media outlets for two years. The court heard Wilkinson didn\u2019t receive notice of the defamation claim until the day after it commenced. Other publishers, including News Corp, Network Ten and Samantha Maiden, received notice of the claim on 16 December. That indicated that Lehrmann had never wanted to settle with Wilkinson, Chrysanthou said. \u201cHe always intended to sue her, she was the top of his list,\u201d Chrysanthou said. Chrysanthou said there was no explanation for Lehrmann not sending a letter of demand or concerns notice to any of the publishers for almost two years after the initial publications. \u201cWhy did he not send a concerns notice ever, that has not been explained, within the limitation period, why was no concerns notice sent? Or even just a letter of demand sent to my client saying \u2018I intend to sue you, be on notice\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has been no explanation for that and that is a highly relevant matter to the exercise of the discretion [to extend].\u201d Collins said any prejudice could have been avoided by simply delaying the defamation trial until after criminal proceedings concluded, something which was commonly done. Even if he had to give evidence in a defamation trial first, Lehrmann could have been given certificates preventing his testimony from being used against him in criminal proceedings. Richardson argued that it was clear that federal police were actively investigating the allegations well before charges were laid in August 2021, taking the court to statements made by police in March of that year. Richardson also said it was implausible that a lawyer would have ever advised Lehrmann that he wouldn\u2019t have faced criminal prosecution, given what had appeared in the media. He said no competent lawyer would have told Lehrmann such a thing. \u201cIt\u2019s just silly, in my respectful submission, that something like that would have been said,\u201d he told the court. Chrysanthou said there were many high-profile examples where public figures had immediately filed defamation claims after being accused in public media reporting of criminal conduct, which gave rise to the possibility of criminal proceedings. \u201cThe notion that there\u2019s some generalised or ordinary rule in favour of extension because there\u2019s a possibility of criminal charges cannot be right and the notion that there\u2019s some ordinary rule when charges have already been laid is not right either,\u201d she said. Lehmrann denies raping Higgins and pleaded not guilty at an earlier criminal trial, which was aborted due to juror misconduct. A retrial was not pursued due to concerns about Higgins\u2019 mental health. The two-day hearing concluded late Thursday afternoon. Lee will hand down a decision at a later date.

Lehrmann is trying to convince the federal court to give him an extension to the usual 12-month time limit on bringing defamation claims, blaming the delay on the criminal proceedings, prior legal advice to not immediately pursue defamation proceedings and his mental health. On Thursday, the court had expected to hear evidence from Lehrmann\u2019s former lawyer, Warwick Korn, about the advice he gave his then client after News Corp and Network Ten first published Brittany Higgins\u2019 allegations of rape on 15 February 2021. Lehrmann said Korn told him to wait until criminal proceedings were over before filing a defamation claim.\nKorn, however, was not called to give evidence on Thursday, a change described as \u201cremarkable\u201d by Network Ten\u2019s lawyers. Lehrmann and the media outlets instead made their final arguments to Justice Michael Lee on whether the 12-month time limit should be extended. Matthew Collins KC, representing Network Ten, said it was clearly not reasonable for Lehrmann to fail to file the defamation claim within one year. Collins said a series of text messages to his then girlfriend and friends, sent from Korn\u2019s office on the day of the initial publications in News Corp and Network Ten, show he had been advised not to worry about a criminal prosecution and told he could make millions of dollars in a defamation claim. \u201cIf I\u2019m named tonight, he says I\u2019m up for millions as defamation,\u201d Lehrmann told his then girlfriend in one message. In another text, he suggested he had received advice that he would not face criminal proceedings and that the criminal allegations would \u201cnot see the light of a courtroom\u201d. He said Lehrmann was effectively told \u201cyou\u2019ve got a red hot defamation case, you\u2019re going to make millions, don\u2019t worry about the prosecution\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup To not file a defamation claim in such circumstances, Collins said, was clearly not reasonable. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a plaintiff who says I\u2019m primarily focused on my reputation, I\u2019ve been told there won\u2019t be a prosecution, I\u2019m exploring getting a PR agent, I\u2019m exploring talking to the media \u2026 yet doesn\u2019t send a concerns notice, doesn\u2019t even put the defendants on notice of a claim,\u201d Collins told the court. Lehrmann has since said he never received any such legal advice. He says the texts were fabrications, designed to put on a \u201cbrave face\u201d and reassure his then girlfriend and friends. Collins said Lehrmann\u2019s claims about fabricating the texts were \u201cinherently unbelievable\u201d. Earlier, Matthew Richardson SC, representing Lehrmann, argued that the criminal charges laid against his client in August 2021, and the prospect of those charges, meant that Lehrmann would have been \u201cexposed to prejudice\u201d had he brought defamation action within the usual one-year time limit. Richardson said that risk of prejudice is reason enough for Lehrmann not to have brought a defamation claim within 12 months. If Lehrmann had brought defamation claims, it may have required him to give evidence in civil proceedings prior to any criminal trial, compromising his right to silence, Richardson said. \u201cOur position is that commencing civil litigation on almost entirely the same issues would have exposed him to prejudice,\u201d he said. But both Network Ten and Wilkinson rejected that he could have been exposed to prejudice. Sue Chrysanthou SC, representing Wilkinson, questioned why Lehrmann had not even sent a letter of demand or concerns notice to media outlets for two years. The court heard Wilkinson didn\u2019t receive notice of the defamation claim until the day after it commenced. Other publishers, including News Corp, Network Ten and Samantha Maiden, received notice of the claim on 16 December. That indicated that Lehrmann had never wanted to settle with Wilkinson, Chrysanthou said. \u201cHe always intended to sue her, she was the top of his list,\u201d Chrysanthou said. Chrysanthou said there was no explanation for Lehrmann not sending a letter of demand or concerns notice to any of the publishers for almost two years after the initial publications. \u201cWhy did he not send a concerns notice ever, that has not been explained, within the limitation period, why was no concerns notice sent? Or even just a letter of demand sent to my client saying \u2018I intend to sue you, be on notice\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has been no explanation for that and that is a highly relevant matter to the exercise of the discretion [to extend].\u201d Collins said any prejudice could have been avoided by simply delaying the defamation trial until after criminal proceedings concluded, something which was commonly done. Even if he had to give evidence in a defamation trial first, Lehrmann could have been given certificates preventing his testimony from being used against him in criminal proceedings. Richardson argued that it was clear that federal police were actively investigating the allegations well before charges were laid in August 2021, taking the court to statements made by police in March of that year. Richardson also said it was implausible that a lawyer would have ever advised Lehrmann that he wouldn\u2019t have faced criminal prosecution, given what had appeared in the media. He said no competent lawyer would have told Lehrmann such a thing. \u201cIt\u2019s just silly, in my respectful submission, that something like that would have been said,\u201d he told the court. Chrysanthou said there were many high-profile examples where public figures had immediately filed defamation claims after being accused in public media reporting of criminal conduct, which gave rise to the possibility of criminal proceedings. \u201cThe notion that there\u2019s some generalised or ordinary rule in favour of extension because there\u2019s a possibility of criminal charges cannot be right and the notion that there\u2019s some ordinary rule when charges have already been laid is not right either,\u201d she said. Lehmrann denies raping Higgins and pleaded not guilty at an earlier criminal trial, which was aborted due to juror misconduct. A retrial was not pursued due to concerns about Higgins\u2019 mental health. The two-day hearing concluded late Thursday afternoon. Lee will hand down a decision at a later date. The court heard that if the case does proceed to trial, it would take many months. Lehrmann\u2019s legal team said their limited resources mean they would not be ready to proceed in August.

Graeme Virtue Tonight: Customers \u2013 Are We Being Served? 8.30pm, ITV1 As figures reveal customer complaints have rocketed to the highest levels in more than a decade, UK businesses seem unfazed by losing billions of pounds. Adam Shaw looks into this David and Goliath battle. Danielle De Wolfe The Apprentice: The Final 9pm, BBC One There\u2019s a \u00a3250,000 investment on the table and two exhausted finalists, Rochelle and Marnie, who must now face the ultimate humiliation: putting on their glad-rags to pitch their businesses to Lord Sugar at a black-tie event. At least they can call on \u201csupport\u201d from returning \u201cfriends\u201d, fired earlier. Ellen E Jones Cold Case Detectives 9pm, ITV It\u2019s the finale of this real-life Unforgotten, in which police reopen unsolved crimes. As a 40-year-old rape investigation is renewed after DNA testing of a semen stain, this look at the legwork involved in trying to achieve long-delayed justice is curiously emotion-free. Alexi Duggins A Town Called Malice 9pm, Sky Max More Costa del Crime capers from Nick Love, revisiting territory he explored nearly 20 years ago in The Business, replete with pastel sportswear and wall-to-wall 80s hits. This week, the Lord family arrive in Spain, and grizzled, dad-dancing patriarch Albert (Jason Flemyng) has some questions for an under-suspicion Gene. Ali Catterall Film choice The Naked Kiss (Samuel Fuller, 1964), 1.40am, Talking Pictures TV Samuel Fuller\u2019s bold, brutal melodrama takes a wrecking ball to the hidden hypocrisies and crimes of small-town American life. Sex worker Kelly (Constance Towers) reinvents herself as a nurse for disabled children in white-picket-fence Grantville. Despite the police chief\u2019s refusal to believe her career change is for real, she finds a good man who loves her, Michael Dante\u2019s wealthy local bigwig. But all is not as it appears \u2026 Fuller\u2019s pulp fiction roots are clear in the plot twists, but there is real humanity at play here, too.

(It did not mention my grandfather \u2013 that was, of course, the real test!) It was very impressive and I thought right away if I had to write something about a movie, I might use that as a springboard.\u201d</p> <p>But how does Mankiewicz, 55, feel about the idea of AI writing an entire film script? \u201cWhile it\u2019s exciting, of course it\u2019s disturbing. I find it very hard to believe that it\u2019s ever going to get the humanity that makes a screenplay great. I have to believe that the things that my grandfather did that made his movies great, that Joe Mankiewicz did, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/16/dalton-trumbo-hollywood-blacklist-mitzi-trumbo-bryan-cranston\">Dalton Trumbo</a> did, that Scott Frank did, are impossible for the the AI program to get right.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m worried but I don\u2019t want to sound reactionary. It\u2019s probably OK. It\u2019s probably mostly useful if it gets a creative person who finds the blank page daunting to think, \u2018Oh, all right, here\u2019s some pages, here\u2019s some ideas.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The Writers Guild of America, which represents TV and film writers, has stopped short of calling for an outright ban on AI.

Look at how fast the technology has advanced in the past couple of months even. It probably will be a real threat to writers down the road.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s to say that ChatGPT won\u2019t be ready in very short order to do a pass on a script, revisions on a script? They could even say: \u2018Do a set of revisions in the style of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/07/she-was-very-complicated-she-was-a-conundrum-who-was-the-real-lucille-ball\">Aaron Sorkin</a>.\u2019 If you were to ask me what do I think we\u2019re going to see sooner rather than later it\u2019s that, rather crafting an entire script from a blank page.\u201d</p> <p>The tech industry is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/13/just-nine-out-of-116-ai-professionals-in-films-are-women-study-finds\">notoriously male dominated</a> and AI is no different. Guggenheim, 52, comments:<em> </em>\u201cWhere is the AI getting its information to be programmed and is that information only coming from a certain subset of society? If it\u2019s going to tell stories from the perspective of its programmers, essentially, then you have to worry about the lack of diversity among the programmers.\u201d</p> <p>Writers are not the only ones facing potential upheaval.

We hope that potentially we could help guide this technology or be a part of the conversation as it goes forward.\u201d</p> <p>Not everything that AI touches will be obvious on screen.

Who better to answer that question than ChatGPT, a thrilling but scary chatbot developed by OpenAI. When the Guardian asked it about AI\u2019s potential impact on the film industry, it made the following points: Scriptwriting: AI can be used to analyze existing screenplays and create new ones, potentially leading to more efficient and cost-effective screenwriting. Pre-production: AI can be used to streamline the pre-production process, including casting, location scouting and storyboarding. Special effects: AI can be used to create more realistic and immersive special effects, potentially reducing the need for practical effects and saving time and money in post-production. Audience analysis: AI can be used to analyze audience data and preferences, helping studios make more informed decisions about which films to greenlight and how to market them. Distribution: AI can be used to personalize movie recommendations for viewers and optimize distribution strategies, potentially leading to higher ticket sales and revenue. It was a reasonable answer that did not hint at HAL 9000-style malevolence or Terminator-like plans for world domination. But nor did it have much to say about how AI might be a disruptive force for actors (dead or alive), audiences, screenwriters, the principle of intellectual property or the fundamental art of storytelling. When the Guardian turned to human interviewees, they offered a more ambivalent set of predictions \u2013 acknowledging the power of AI to help a screenwriter overcome writer\u2019s block or an editor to skip mundane tasks, but expressing alarm about the risk of machines replacing humans or effectively forcing them to work for free. AI is already here. It can be heard in synthesised voices and seen in visual effects such as deep fakes and de-ageing. It has been used to knock decades off Harrison Ford for a scene in the upcoming Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Not all ageing action stars are happy about the technology, however. Last month Keanu Reeves told Wired magazine of a clause in his film contracts that bans studios from digitally editing his performances. \u201cIf you go into deepfake land, it has none of your points of view,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s scary.\u201d Meanwhile ChatGPT has taken the world by storm with its facility for writing essays, news reports and poems and even passing business and law school exams. It may only be a matter of time before it can come up with a decent script treatment or turn a novel into a blockbuster screenplay. Ben Mankiewicz, a primetime host of Turner Classic Movies (TCM) and grandson of Herman Mankiewicz, who co-wrote the 1941 classic Citizen Kane, has just been experimenting with ChatGPT. \u201cI signed up for a week and asked it to write a TCM introduction for Citizen Kane,\u201d he says by phone from Los Angeles. \u201cIt lacked some detail and context but it was pretty well written and thoughtful and certainly got the movie\u2019s importance and mentioned Gregg Toland, the cinematographer. (It did not mention my grandfather \u2013 that was, of course, the real test!) It was very impressive and I thought right away if I had to write something about a movie, I might use that as a springboard.\u201d But how does Mankiewicz, 55, feel about the idea of AI writing an entire film script? \u201cWhile it\u2019s exciting, of course it\u2019s disturbing. I find it very hard to believe that it\u2019s ever going to get the humanity that makes a screenplay great. I have to believe that the things that my grandfather did that made his movies great, that Joe Mankiewicz did, that Dalton Trumbo did, that Scott Frank did, are impossible for the the AI program to get right. \u201cI\u2019m worried but I don\u2019t want to sound reactionary. It\u2019s probably OK. It\u2019s probably mostly useful if it gets a creative person who finds the blank page daunting to think, \u2018Oh, all right, here\u2019s some pages, here\u2019s some ideas.\u2019\u201d The Writers Guild of America, which represents TV and film writers, has stopped short of calling for an outright ban on AI. Instead it is proposing that writers could use chatbots to help write a script without having to share the credit or divide residuals, according to a report this week in Variety. But some screenwriters are already worried about how far the AI revolution might go. Marc Guggenheim, who has numerous film and TV credits and is also author of the LegalDispatch newsletter, sees both promise and peril in the technology. He says: \u201cRight now I don\u2019t think AI is ready for primetime in terms of being able to write scripts or craft stories but I see a world where it absolutely will be able to do that. Look at how fast the technology has advanced in the past couple of months even. It probably will be a real threat to writers down the road. \u201cWho\u2019s to say that ChatGPT won\u2019t be ready in very short order to do a pass on a script, revisions on a script? They could even say: \u2018Do a set of revisions in the style of Aaron Sorkin.\u2019 If you were to ask me what do I think we\u2019re going to see sooner rather than later it\u2019s that, rather crafting an entire script from a blank page.\u201d The tech industry is notoriously male dominated and AI is no different. Guggenheim, 52, comments: \u201cWhere is the AI getting its information to be programmed and is that information only coming from a certain subset of society? If it\u2019s going to tell stories from the perspective of its programmers, essentially, then you have to worry about the lack of diversity among the programmers.\u201d Writers are not the only ones facing potential upheaval. The voices of celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain and artist Andy Warhol were posthumously recreated by AI in the documentaries Roadrunner and The Andy Warhol Diaries. Actor James Earl Jones has given his approval for AI to use early Darth Vader recordings to replicate his voice in future Star Wars series. The National Association of Voice Actors, an advocacy group, insists that it is not anti-technology or anti-AI but is calling for stronger regulation. It warns that it is increasingly hard to know when and where synthesised voices are replacing humans in audio books, video games and other media. The group\u2019s president, Tim Friedlander, says: \u201cThe biggest concern is that we just don\u2019t know what\u2019s out there and there\u2019s no way to track it and no way to find out if it\u2019s being used. \u201cFor voice actors, a lot of how we make our our living is based on the licensing of our voice and so, if we have an unlicensed version of our voice working for free, then that is instantly taking work away from us and money out of our pockets and hurting our ability to make a living.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe don\u2019t know if our voices are being used or have been used to train synthetic voices for machine learning or to create synthetic voices that could potentially be out there without our knowledge. We hope that potentially we could help guide this technology or be a part of the conversation as it goes forward.\u201d Not everything that AI touches will be obvious on screen. It could save huge amounts of time and effort in the editing process, during post-production and in film preservation or restoration. AI could sift through vast amounts of footage to locate a certain variable. Joshua Glick, visiting associate professor of film and electronic arts at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, pointed to the benefits of AI in the 2020 documentary film Welcome to Chechnya, which examines the persecution of LGBTQ+ people in the republic in south-western Russia. He says: \u201cThere have been instances where these tools have been used in quite progressive and creative ways. In Welcome to Chechnya Ryan Laney, the effects supervisor, was using deepfake technology as a way to protect the onscreen subjects to essentially create what was called \u2018digital veils\u2019 for the individuals that appear in the film. \u201cIt allowed those people to communicate and engage with audiences but also to maintain their anonymity. That was one instance in the human rights context where the technology is having some impact. There\u2019s been some other projects that Ryan Laney has worked on recently related to protests in Hong Kong and using some of this same technology to protect the people that are appearing on film.\u201d But what if AI was able to script a sequel to Casablanca, recreate the same cast \u2013 deepfakes of Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and co \u2013 simulate their voices and turn it into a finished film that looked convincing? Glick is sceptical. \u201cIt creates a strange relationship between the audience and those characters in the film and the story that they\u2019re involved in. It plunges us into the uncanny valley. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea that we have in our head as audiences of who these people were and what they did. They\u2019re no longer with us and yet we\u2019re seeing them appear on screen, doing all of these dynamic things, playing all these different roles? It creates a cognitive dissonance, or at least I think it would.\u201d Taken to its logical conclusion, a film industry that depended solely on AI, rendering actors extinct, would wipe out the circus of gossip columns, late night TV interviews, red carpet film premieres and the Oscars. That is not a Hollywood that Glick wants to live in. \u201cOur knowledge of who these people are, their personalities, what they\u2019re like, what their families might be like, their background, what they\u2019ve been like on set swirl around a production,\u201d he continues. \u201cThey give the production of a film or TV show a sense of allure and intrigue and a part of what we might call the media culture today. \u201cWhat it means to follow a project as it\u2019s unfolding, not just to watch a finished film or stream a TV show, is important. Our knowledge of the creative labour and these human dimensions of it are part of the enjoyment that spectators derive from the films and part of what makes the film and television industry distinct. It needs to do its business in public.\u201d AI could also have far reaching social and economic consequences. Olcun Tan, a German-born visual effects supervisor based in Los Angeles, says: \u201cIn robotics, in the 80s and 90s, the whole car industry got upset and Detroit was affected very negatively: the whole city turned into a ghost town. This is now happening with the middle class through AI. \u201cA lot of people are not even aware of it. I wonder sometimes if the workforce cuts you see at Microsoft or Google are also driven by the fact that you don\u2019t need three people; you need one person who, with assistance from AI, can do the workload of three people. In the context of movie making, it will take far less people to do the work than originally needed. \u201cIt reduces the prospects for people entering the workforce as an assistant or as somebody doing research to start their career. If the AI does a better job then how do people start getting into an industry to learn from ground up, to grow into a position of expertise eventually?\u201d AI is already earning comparisons to the agricultural revolution, industrial revolution and internet revolution. It is moving fast and gathering speed. The most profound effects for Hollywood and elsewhere have probably not yet been imagined. Tan adds: \u201cI feel we\u2019re creating a world like the Greeks had. They would make pilgrimages and ask the Oracle. In these temples they would have places where you put your hand in and then you would ask for your future.

Who better to answer that question than ChatGPT, a thrilling but scary chatbot developed by OpenAI. When the Guardian asked it about AI\u2019s potential impact on the film industry, it made the following points: Scriptwriting: AI can be used to analyze existing screenplays and create new ones, potentially leading to more efficient and cost-effective screenwriting. Pre-production: AI can be used to streamline the pre-production process, including casting, location scouting and storyboarding. Special effects: AI can be used to create more realistic and immersive special effects, potentially reducing the need for practical effects and saving time and money in post-production. Audience analysis: AI can be used to analyze audience data and preferences, helping studios make more informed decisions about which films to greenlight and how to market them. Distribution: AI can be used to personalize movie recommendations for viewers and optimize distribution strategies, potentially leading to higher ticket sales and revenue. It was a reasonable answer that did not hint at HAL 9000-style malevolence or Terminator-like plans for world domination. But nor did it have much to say about how AI might be a disruptive force for actors (dead or alive), audiences, screenwriters, the principle of intellectual property or the fundamental art of storytelling.\nWhen the Guardian turned to human interviewees, they offered a more ambivalent set of predictions \u2013 acknowledging the power of AI to help a screenwriter overcome writer\u2019s block or an editor to skip mundane tasks, but expressing alarm about the risk of machines replacing humans or effectively forcing them to work for free. AI is already here. It can be heard in synthesised voices and seen in visual effects such as deep fakes and de-ageing. It has been used to knock decades off Harrison Ford for a scene in the upcoming Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Not all ageing action stars are happy about the technology, however. Last month Keanu Reeves told Wired magazine of a clause in his film contracts that bans studios from digitally editing his performances. \u201cIf you go into deepfake land, it has none of your points of view,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s scary.\u201d Meanwhile ChatGPT has taken the world by storm with its facility for writing essays, news reports and poems and even passing business and law school exams.

(It did not mention my grandfather \u2013 that was, of course, the real test!) It was very impressive and I thought right away if I had to write something about a movie, I might use that as a springboard.\u201d</p> \n<p>But how does Mankiewicz, 55, feel about the idea of AI writing an entire film script? \u201cWhile it\u2019s exciting, of course it\u2019s disturbing. I find it very hard to believe that it\u2019s ever going to get the humanity that makes a screenplay great. I have to believe that the things that my grandfather did that made his movies great, that Joe Mankiewicz did, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/16/dalton-trumbo-hollywood-blacklist-mitzi-trumbo-bryan-cranston\">Dalton Trumbo</a> did, that Scott Frank did, are impossible for the the AI program to get right.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m worried but I don\u2019t want to sound reactionary. It\u2019s probably OK. It\u2019s probably mostly useful if it gets a creative person who finds the blank page daunting to think, \u2018Oh, all right, here\u2019s some pages, here\u2019s some ideas.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>The Writers Guild of America, which represents TV and film writers, has stopped short of calling for an outright ban on AI. Instead it is proposing that writers could use chatbots to help write a script without having to share the credit or divide residuals, according to <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/writers-guild-artificial-intelligence-proposal-1235560927/\">a report this week in Variety</a>.</p> \n<p>But some screenwriters are already worried about how far the AI revolution might go. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mguggenheim?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Marc Guggenheim</a>, who has numerous film and TV credits and is also author of the LegalDispatch newsletter, sees both promise and peril in the technology.</p> \n<p>He says: \u201cRight now I don\u2019t think AI is ready for primetime in terms of being able to write scripts or craft stories but I see a world where it absolutely will be able to do that. Look at how fast the technology has advanced in the past couple of months even. It probably will be a real threat to writers down the road.</p> \n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s to say that ChatGPT won\u2019t be ready in very short order to do a pass on a script, revisions on a script? They could even say: \u2018Do a set of revisions in the style of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/07/she-was-very-complicated-she-was-a-conundrum-who-was-the-real-lucille-ball\">Aaron Sorkin</a>.\u2019 If you were to ask me what do I think we\u2019re going to see sooner rather than later it\u2019s that, rather crafting an entire script from a blank page.\u201d</p> \n<p>The tech industry is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/13/just-nine-out-of-116-ai-professionals-in-films-are-women-study-finds\">notoriously male dominated</a> and AI is no different. Guggenheim, 52, comments:<em> </em>\u201cWhere is the AI getting its information to be programmed and is that information only coming from a certain subset of society? If it\u2019s going to tell stories from the perspective of its programmers, essentially, then you have to worry about the lack of diversity among the programmers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Writers are not the only ones facing potential upheaval.

The energy regulator, Ofgem, has admitted that some suppliers may be charging small companies rates that cannot be justified by falling gas market prices. Care England, the largest representative body for care providers in England, warned the energy regulator that care home heating bills had soared by 500% in the past year because suppliers are charging rates that dwarf the current market price for gas. Martin Green, the chief executive of Care England, said: \u201cThere can be no justification for charging such horrendous and financially crippling rates.\u201d The Ofgem chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said in a letter to the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, earlier this month that the regulator was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about reports from consumer groups into the behaviour of suppliers. Brearley said some suppliers appeared to be charging businesses rates that cannot be justified by the market price for gas. They are also demanding significantly higher security deposits and hiking the standing charges for small business customers. Brearley told the chancellor that the regulator does not always have the legal powers to intervene, but it was working with the industry to find \u201ccommonsense ways\u201d to address the issues faced by small businesses. The threat is particularly stark for the care home sector which many fear is sleepwalking into a crisis of rising costs, and typically faces a higher heating burden. Care England told Ofgem last year that some care homes faced gas prices more than 12 times higher than wholesale market prices despite being on so-called \u201cout-of-contract\u201d rates that should be able to reflect falling gas market prices every month. Green has said the impact of soaring gas prices on the adult social care sector is particularly \u201csevere and devastating\u201d because facilities are required to let fresh air into indoor spaces in line with anti-Covid guidance while keeping spaces warm. \u201cThe underlying financial fragility of the sector and energy-intensive nature of services has meant providers are pushed further into what was already an incredibly precarious situation,\u201d Green said. He added that he was pleased that Ofgem had acknowledged that \u201cthere can be no justification for energy suppliers charging unduly onerous financially crippling rates to care providers\u201d. \u201cWhat we now need to see is an immediate resolution to how energy transactions and contracts are regulated and to ensure a fairer approach is continually monitored by the regulator,\u201d he said. A spokesperson for Ofgem said it was investigating reports that energy suppliers were treating public and private sector customers unfairly as part of a market-wide review, and would not hesitate to take action if they have broken the rules. Energy bills remain a big concern for companies despite the government\u2019s energy bills discount scheme, which is designed to lower bills for non-domestic customers. The support has been labelled \u201cscattergun\u201d by business groups. The scheme will become less generous from 1 April after Hunt revealed plans to reduce the level of financial support in January. An annual survey of high energy users by npower Business Solutions found that two-thirds of large businesses believe the scheme will not protect them from the volatile wholesale energy market over the next 12 months.", "charCount": "3518", "shouldHideReaderRevenue": "false", "showAffiliateLinks": "false", "bylineHtml": "<a href=\"profile/jillian-ambrose\">Jillian Ambrose</a> Energy correspondent",

The energy regulator, Ofgem, has admitted that some suppliers may be charging small companies rates that cannot be justified by falling gas market prices. Care England, the largest representative body for care providers in England, warned the energy regulator that care home heating bills had soared by 500% in the past year because suppliers are charging rates that dwarf the current market price for gas. Martin Green, the chief executive of Care England, said: \u201cThere can be no justification for charging such horrendous and financially crippling rates.\u201d The Ofgem chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said in a letter to the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, earlier this month that the regulator was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about reports from consumer groups into the behaviour of suppliers. Brearley said some suppliers appeared to be charging businesses rates that cannot be justified by the market price for gas. They are also demanding significantly higher security deposits and hiking the standing charges for small business customers. Brearley told the chancellor that the regulator does not always have the legal powers to intervene, but it was working with the industry to find \u201ccommonsense ways\u201d to address the issues faced by small businesses. The threat is particularly stark for the care home sector which many fear is sleepwalking into a crisis of rising costs, and typically faces a higher heating burden. Care England told Ofgem last year that some care homes faced gas prices more than 12 times higher than wholesale market prices despite being on so-called \u201cout-of-contract\u201d rates that should be able to reflect falling gas market prices every month. Green has said the impact of soaring gas prices on the adult social care sector is particularly \u201csevere and devastating\u201d because facilities are required to let fresh air into indoor spaces in line with anti-Covid guidance while keeping spaces warm. \u201cThe underlying financial fragility of the sector and energy-intensive nature of services has meant providers are pushed further into what was already an incredibly precarious situation,\u201d Green said. He added that he was pleased that Ofgem had acknowledged that \u201cthere can be no justification for energy suppliers charging unduly onerous financially crippling rates to care providers\u201d. \u201cWhat we now need to see is an immediate resolution to how energy transactions and contracts are regulated and to ensure a fairer approach is continually monitored by the regulator,\u201d he said. A spokesperson for Ofgem said it was investigating reports that energy suppliers were treating public and private sector customers unfairly as part of a market-wide review, and would not hesitate to take action if they have broken the rules. Energy bills remain a big concern for companies despite the government\u2019s energy bills discount scheme, which is designed to lower bills for non-domestic customers. The support has been labelled \u201cscattergun\u201d by business groups. The scheme will become less generous from 1 April after Hunt revealed plans to reduce the level of financial support in January. An annual survey of high energy users by npower Business Solutions found that two-thirds of large businesses believe the scheme will not protect them from the volatile wholesale energy market over the next 12 months.", "attributes": {}, "published": true, "createdDate": "2023-03-23T06:00:03Z", "firstPublishedDate": "2023-03-23T06:00:03Z", "publishedDate": "2023-03-23T09:34:07Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-03-23T09:34:07Z", "contributors": [], "elements": [{"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>A third of care homes across England have considered closing during the past year because of \u201cfinancially crippling\u201d running costs, as concerns rise that gas suppliers are profiteering at the expense of small businesses.</p> \n<p>The energy regulator, Ofgem, has admitted that some suppliers may be charging small companies rates that cannot be justified <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/03/why-are-wholesale-gas-prices-falling-cut-uk-bills-power-cuts\">by falling gas market prices</a>.</p> \n<p>Care England, the largest representative body for care providers in England, warned the energy regulator that care home heating bills had soared by 500% in the past year because suppliers are charging rates that dwarf the current market price for gas.</p> \n<p>Martin Green, the chief executive of Care England, said: \u201cThere can be no justification for charging such horrendous and financially crippling rates.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Ofgem chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said in a letter to the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, earlier this month that the regulator was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about reports from consumer groups into the behaviour of suppliers.</p> \n<p>Brearley said some suppliers appeared to be charging businesses rates that cannot be justified by the market price for gas.

But for a truly responsible public health-oriented response, India should have also warned other countries to whom the same cough syrup was exported to remove it from circulation. State-level Indian drug inspectors involved in the investigation, who confirmed that the company was exporting to multiple countries, have publicly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/india-may-issue-alert-marion-cough-syrup-exports-after-toxins-found-2023-03-04/\">expressed their concerns</a> on the urgency of informing other countries in order to prevent further casualties.</p> <p>These tragedies and the response of the Indian government raise two important issues from a global health perspective.</p> <p>First, the efficacy of existing international mechanisms to guarantee quality in cross-border commerce of medicine. Created in 1969 by a resolution of the World Health Assembly, the current framework to regulate the quality of medicine is a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/regulation-prequalification/regulation-and-safety/regulatory-convergence-networks/certification-scheme/provisions-objectives\">self-certification mechanism</a> that depends entirely on national regulatory authorities of exporting countries to issue a \u201ccertificate of pharmaceutical product\u201d (COPP) along with each export consignment. This certificate guarantees to the importing countries that the medicine has been manufactured in a facility that complies with \u201cgood manufacturing practices\u201d as recommended by the WHO; that all product information including labelling is authorised by the certifying country; and that the product is authorised to be placed on the market of the certifying country.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We cannot find a single instance of prosecution by Indian authorities, despite evidence of brazen data fraud</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Under this mechanism, the WHO has no real authority to conduct inspections. Trading partners of countries like India are essentially at the mercy of Indian regulators to be competent at their jobs.</p> <p>This is precisely why developed countries like the US and much of Europe send their own drug inspectors to India to check manufacturing facilities. Over the past decade, these inspectors have uncovered a plethora of scandals in manufacturing facilities and clinical research organisations which generate regulatory data for pharmaceutical companies.</p> <p>India\u2019s national drug regulator has mostly turned a Nelson\u2019s eye toward all these scandals. We cannot find a single instance of prosecution by Indian authorities, despite evidence of brazen data fraud.</p> <p>The knowledge of efficient foreign inspections among the Indian pharmaceutical industry has given rise to dual-track manufacturing in India. Facilities monitored by American and European inspectors produce better-quality medicine than those that cater to developing countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia who cannot afford to send their regulators to India to inspect manufacturing facilities.</p> <p>It is this precise problem that needs to be solved through an international treaty if we are to avoid future tragedies.</p> <p>The second issue, particularly relevant after these multiple cross-border deaths, is the urgent need for an international legal framework to allow swift cross-border investigations, mandatory sharing of information after a tragedy and a compensation mechanism for victims.</p> <p>These investigations are also necessary to enable emergency public health measures such as a swift recall of contaminated medicine from the global market before more patients come to harm. There is currently no international legal framework to govern such investigations or to ensure that compensation is payable to cross-border victims.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/mar/11/profiteering-of-covid-pandemic-must-never-be-repeated-world-figures-warn\">\u2018Profiteering\u2019 of Covid pandemic must never be repeated, world figures warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the years, the pharmaceutical industry has managed to protect its interests through international treaties like the <a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/trips_e.htm\">Trips agreement</a> on trade-related intellectual property rights, which forced every country to protect patent rights of the industry.

This certificate guarantees to the importing countries that the medicine has been manufactured in a facility that complies with \u201cgood manufacturing practices\u201d as recommended by the WHO; that all product information including labelling is authorised by the certifying country; and that the product is authorised to be placed on the market of the certifying country. Under this mechanism, the WHO has no real authority to conduct inspections. Trading partners of countries like India are essentially at the mercy of Indian regulators to be competent at their jobs. This is precisely why developed countries like the US and much of Europe send their own drug inspectors to India to check manufacturing facilities. Over the past decade, these inspectors have uncovered a plethora of scandals in manufacturing facilities and clinical research organisations which generate regulatory data for pharmaceutical companies. India\u2019s national drug regulator has mostly turned a Nelson\u2019s eye toward all these scandals. We cannot find a single instance of prosecution by Indian authorities, despite evidence of brazen data fraud. The knowledge of efficient foreign inspections among the Indian pharmaceutical industry has given rise to dual-track manufacturing in India. Facilities monitored by American and European inspectors produce better-quality medicine than those that cater to developing countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia who cannot afford to send their regulators to India to inspect manufacturing facilities. It is this precise problem that needs to be solved through an international treaty if we are to avoid future tragedies. The second issue, particularly relevant after these multiple cross-border deaths, is the urgent need for an international legal framework to allow swift cross-border investigations, mandatory sharing of information after a tragedy and a compensation mechanism for victims. These investigations are also necessary to enable emergency public health measures such as a swift recall of contaminated medicine from the global market before more patients come to harm. There is currently no international legal framework to govern such investigations or to ensure that compensation is payable to cross-border victims. Over the years, the pharmaceutical industry has managed to protect its interests through international treaties like the Trips agreement on trade-related intellectual property rights, which forced every country to protect patent rights of the industry. Why then has the global health community failed to use international law to hold the pharmaceutical industry liable for its misdeeds?

This certificate guarantees to the importing countries that the medicine has been manufactured in a facility that complies with \u201cgood manufacturing practices\u201d as recommended by the WHO; that all product information including labelling is authorised by the certifying country; and that the product is authorised to be placed on the market of the certifying country.</p>"}}, {"type": "pullquote", "assets": [], "pullquoteTypeData": {"html": "We cannot find a single instance of prosecution by Indian authorities, despite evidence of brazen data fraud", "role": "supporting"}}, {"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>Under this mechanism, the WHO has no real authority to conduct inspections. Trading partners of countries like India are essentially at the mercy of Indian regulators to be competent at their jobs.</p> \n<p>This is precisely why developed countries like the US and much of Europe send their own drug inspectors to India to check manufacturing facilities. Over the past decade, these inspectors have uncovered a plethora of scandals in manufacturing facilities and clinical research organisations which generate regulatory data for pharmaceutical companies.</p> \n<p>India\u2019s national drug regulator has mostly turned a Nelson\u2019s eye toward all these scandals. We cannot find a single instance of prosecution by Indian authorities, despite evidence of brazen data fraud.</p> \n<p>The knowledge of efficient foreign inspections among the Indian pharmaceutical industry has given rise to dual-track manufacturing in India. Facilities monitored by American and European inspectors produce better-quality medicine than those that cater to developing countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia who cannot afford to send their regulators to India to inspect manufacturing facilities.</p> \n<p>It is this precise problem that needs to be solved through an international treaty if we are to avoid future tragedies.</p> \n<p>The second issue, particularly relevant after these multiple cross-border deaths, is the urgent need for an international legal framework to allow swift cross-border investigations, mandatory sharing of information after a tragedy and a compensation mechanism for victims.</p> \n<p>These investigations are also necessary to enable emergency public health measures such as a swift recall of contaminated medicine from the global market before more patients come to harm. There is currently no international legal framework to govern such investigations or to ensure that compensation is payable to cross-border victims.</p>"}}, {"type": "rich-link", "assets": [], "richLinkTypeData": {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/mar/11/profiteering-of-covid-pandemic-must-never-be-repeated-world-figures-warn", "originalUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/mar/11/profiteering-of-covid-pandemic-must-never-be-repeated-world-figures-warn", "linkText": "\u2018Profiteering\u2019 of Covid pandemic must never be repeated, world figures warn", "linkPrefix": "Related: ", "role": "thumbnail"}}, {"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>Over the years, the pharmaceutical industry has managed to protect its interests through international treaties like the <a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/trips_e.htm\">Trips agreement</a> on trade-related intellectual property rights, which forced every country to protect patent rights of the industry.

Rather than properly managing its supplies, Thames Water wants to pipe huge volumes across the country from another catchment: the Severn.</p> <p>Upstream solutions are never more fitting than when managing water. There\u2019s a clear hierarchy of responsible action. First, you should seek to reduce demand. The UK has one of <a href=\"https://smartwatermagazine.com/news/locken/water-ranking-europe-2020\">Europe\u2019s highest levels</a> of household water consumption, and in England we each use, on average, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/31/drought-water-queues-uk-hosepipe-ban-compulsory-metering\">141 litres a day.</a> Countries that take water conservation seriously use much less: just over 100 litres in Denmark, 95 in Belgium. Compulsory water metering would bring us closer to the Danish level, but the government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/31/drought-water-queues-uk-hosepipe-ban-compulsory-metering\">ruled it out</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/22/water-firms-focused-on-returns-at-expense-of-environment-say-peers\">Water firms focused on returns at expense of environment, say peers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Worse still, the private abstraction of water from rivers and aquifers in England is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/11/environment-agency-has-no-idea-how-much-water-is-taken-says-whistleblower\">effectively unmonitored</a>: a shocking scandal. Amazingly, the businesses abstracting water have no obligation to use meters. The system is entirely \u201cself-regulated\u201d, which means not regulated at all.</p> <p>The second obvious step is to reduce leakage. Thames Water has the highest leakage rate in England, losing around <a href=\"https://www.nationalworld.com/news/environment/uk-water-companies-most-leakages-suppliers-compare-bosses-millions-3812613\">635m litres a day</a>. Again, the government has done almost nothing to ensure this improves. On the contrary, since 2002 the water industry regulator, Ofwat, has allowed water companies not to fix leaks if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/22/water-regulator-ofwat-licence-to-leak-mps-and-charities\">cost of doing so is greater</a> than the financial value of the water being lost. The logic of capitalism, in this privatised industry, trumps the logic of public service and resource protection.</p> <p>The third step is to use <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/OECD.pdf\">nature-based solutions</a> to hold back water in the catchment, releasing it slowly to reduce the extremes of droughts and floods. Reconnecting rivers to their floodplains, allowing them to braid and meander, letting new wetlands form, reintroducing beavers: this rewilding enhances the resilience of the water system. But the UK has been dismally slow to adopt it.</p> <p>If these measures are still insufficient, the next obvious step is to build new reservoirs. But <a href=\"https://www.ciwem.org/assets/pdf/Policy/Policy%20Position%20Statement/New-public-water-supply-reservoirs.pdf\">no new reservoir</a> in the UK was commissioned for 30 years, following privatisation in 1989.

The system is entirely \u201cself-regulated\u201d, which means not regulated at all.</p> \n<p>The second obvious step is to reduce leakage. Thames Water has the highest leakage rate in England, losing around <a href=\"https://www.nationalworld.com/news/environment/uk-water-companies-most-leakages-suppliers-compare-bosses-millions-3812613\">635m litres a day</a>. Again, the government has done almost nothing to ensure this improves. On the contrary, since 2002 the water industry regulator, Ofwat, has allowed water companies not to fix leaks if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/22/water-regulator-ofwat-licence-to-leak-mps-and-charities\">cost of doing so is greater</a> than the financial value of the water being lost.

Reconnecting rivers to their floodplains, allowing them to braid and meander, letting new wetlands form, reintroducing beavers: this rewilding enhances the resilience of the water system. But the UK has been dismally slow to adopt it.</p> \n<p>If these measures are still insufficient, the next obvious step is to build new reservoirs. But <a href=\"https://www.ciwem.org/assets/pdf/Policy/Policy%20Position%20Statement/New-public-water-supply-reservoirs.pdf\">no new reservoir</a> in the UK was commissioned for 30 years, following privatisation in 1989.

What\u2019s a night agent, I hear you ask? Well, in this case, he is an FBI agent called Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso), who saves a bunch of ordinary joes from a bomb on a subway train. For some reason, he is put on desk duties in the basement of the White House, doing admin while he waits by a helpline phone that undercover operatives can call to let the powers-that-be know they are in trouble.</p> <p>But that darn phone never rings. Peter does his admin conscientiously, but you know that in his heart of hearts he would like some thrills \u2013 maybe even of a political nature.</p> <p>As luck would have it, across town, a (professional and romantic) couple of undercover operatives are in trouble. Just before they have to fight for their lives \u2013 but just after we hear them whispering about a possible Russian mole in the White House \u2013 they dispatch their niece Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan) to a phone down the street to call \u2026 yes. The phone! <em>The</em> phone! </p> <p>While our undercover lovers are being killed, the president\u2019s chief-of-staff, Diane Farr (Hong Chau), puts Peter in charge of keeping Rose safe. \u201cIf she called your number, this is more important than you can imagine,\u201d she says. \u201cI trust you completely.\u201d</p> <p>I have many questions about this (and more about why they chose to put a 43-year-old actor in such a cheap grey wig, like the Witch of Endor in a business suit), but there is no time to ask, because more plot is happening! The script is finding its feet as we go!</p> <p>This includes two car chases, much shooting, some running out of bullets, a safe house, a gun safe in a coffee table, a villain with a ring bearing the crest of the Royal House of Yugoslavia that Peter suspects may be a clue, villains without any rings, and a particularly ruthless Bonnie and Clyde couple, possibly of Russian extraction. This is all before Rose tells Peter that Aunt and Uncle Spy were worried there was a mole in the White House. Now, they can trust no one and have to go rogue.</p> <p>It is propulsive, slicker-than-slick fun, with every hairpin turn perfectly negotiated. There are fine performances \u2013 especially from Basso, who is getting two or three notes out of what could easily have been a one-note part. It gives you that warm feeling you get when you come across something a little bit better than it needs to be. You could not ask for more out of your adaptation of a bestselling political thriller about a night agent. I feel as if I am about one and a half measures of plot away from losing the thread entirely, but I feel like that a lot.</p> <p>The showrunner is Shawn Ryan, most recently responsible for the show S.W.A.T., but who was also behind one of the cleverest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/30/all-hail-the-shield-the-scuzzy-forgotten-classic-of-tvs-golden-age\">most underrated police series of recent decades</a>. The Shield was an extraordinary creation \u2013 brilliant long and short narrative arcs examining the corruption of the system and the soul, excellent performances \u2013 not just from the mainstays such as Michael Chiklis, Jay Karnes and Walton Goggins, but also from guest stars such as Forest Whitaker, who was unforgettable \u2013 and characters of a complexity to rival anything in The Wire.</p> <p>I wonder how much Ryan longs to get his teeth into something like that again? You couldn\u2019t blame him if he was still, 15 years on, recovering from seven seasons of interrogating all the ways men can brutalise each other. And their cats. (If you know, you know.

What\u2019s a night agent, I hear you ask? Well, in this case, he is an FBI agent called Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso), who saves a bunch of ordinary joes from a bomb on a subway train. For some reason, he is put on desk duties in the basement of the White House, doing admin while he waits by a helpline phone that undercover operatives can call to let the powers-that-be know they are in trouble. But that darn phone never rings. Peter does his admin conscientiously, but you know that in his heart of hearts he would like some thrills \u2013 maybe even of a political nature. As luck would have it, across town, a (professional and romantic) couple of undercover operatives are in trouble. Just before they have to fight for their lives \u2013 but just after we hear them whispering about a possible Russian mole in the White House \u2013 they dispatch their niece Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan) to a phone down the street to call \u2026 yes. The phone! The phone! While our undercover lovers are being killed, the president\u2019s chief-of-staff, Diane Farr (Hong Chau), puts Peter in charge of keeping Rose safe. \u201cIf she called your number, this is more important than you can imagine,\u201d she says. \u201cI trust you completely.\u201d I have many questions about this (and more about why they chose to put a 43-year-old actor in such a cheap grey wig, like the Witch of Endor in a business suit), but there is no time to ask, because more plot is happening! The script is finding its feet as we go! This includes two car chases, much shooting, some running out of bullets, a safe house, a gun safe in a coffee table, a villain with a ring bearing the crest of the Royal House of Yugoslavia that Peter suspects may be a clue, villains without any rings, and a particularly ruthless Bonnie and Clyde couple, possibly of Russian extraction. This is all before Rose tells Peter that Aunt and Uncle Spy were worried there was a mole in the White House. Now, they can trust no one and have to go rogue. It is propulsive, slicker-than-slick fun, with every hairpin turn perfectly negotiated. There are fine performances \u2013 especially from Basso, who is getting two or three notes out of what could easily have been a one-note part. It gives you that warm feeling you get when you come across something a little bit better than it needs to be. You could not ask for more out of your adaptation of a bestselling political thriller about a night agent. I feel as if I am about one and a half measures of plot away from losing the thread entirely, but I feel like that a lot. The showrunner is Shawn Ryan, most recently responsible for the show S.W.A.T., but who was also behind one of the cleverest, most underrated police series of recent decades. The Shield was an extraordinary creation \u2013 brilliant long and short narrative arcs examining the corruption of the system and the soul, excellent performances \u2013 not just from the mainstays such as Michael Chiklis, Jay Karnes and Walton Goggins, but also from guest stars such as Forest Whitaker, who was unforgettable \u2013 and characters of a complexity to rival anything in The Wire. I wonder how much Ryan longs to get his teeth into something like that again? You couldn\u2019t blame him if he was still, 15 years on, recovering from seven seasons of interrogating all the ways men can brutalise each other. And their cats. (If you know, you know. Goddamn, Dutch \u2026) Anyway, The Night Agent is set fair to deliver a lot of bang for your 10-episode buck. I think the mole is hiding under Diane\u2019s wig. Also, now that I have realised whom Basso reminds me of (a finer-featured Richard Madden in Bodyguard), I can hopefully concentrate a bit better and not lose the thread of things until maybe three or even four episodes in. I look forward to finding out. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 March 2023 to correct the first name of actor Walton Goggins.

The next few weeks will help shine further light on a process that has the potential to help many thousands more shape the futures of all their family members.\u201d</p>"}}]}], "totalBodyBlocks": 1}, "rights": {"syndicatable": "true", "subscriptionDatabases": "true", "developerCommunity": "true"}, "section": {"id": "law", "webTitle": "Law", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/law", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/law", "editions": [{"id": "law", "webTitle": "Law", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/law", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/law", "code": "default"}]}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2023/mar/23/new-zealand-child-poverty-rate-remains-static-despite-ardern-era-push", "type": "article", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webPublicationDate": "2023-03-23T05:49:56Z", "webTitle": "New Zealand child poverty rate remains static despite Ardern-era push", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/23/new-zealand-child-poverty-rate-remains-static-despite-ardern-era-push", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/23/new-zealand-child-poverty-rate-remains-static-despite-ardern-era-push", "fields": {"headline": "New Zealand child poverty rate remains static despite Ardern-era push", "standfirst": "<p>The then leader had made improving the lives of the poorest children a key plank of her agenda</p>", "trailText": "The then leader had made improving the lives of the poorest children a key plank of her agenda", "byline": "Tess McClure in Auckland", "main": "<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"265608119db753f13b923bb3d6ca14119bb50958\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/265608119db753f13b923bb3d6ca14119bb50958/0_0_7984_4791/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reducing child poverty rates were a signature issue for former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerry Marshall/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>", "body": "<p>New Zealand\u2019s child poverty rates have plateaued, despite government efforts and former leader Jacinda Ardern making it a central priority of her prime ministership.</p> <p>Reducing the country\u2019s stubborn child poverty rates has been a central commitment of the Labour government since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/25/jacinda-ardern-takes-child-poverty-role-in-new-zealand-ministry\">Ardern ran on the issue in 2017</a>, creating a new minister for child poverty, introducing legislation to ensure child poverty data was measured and published yearly, and bringing in a series of additional financial support packages for low-income families.</p> <p>While the situation has improved for some children since then, in the year ended June 2022, New Zealand\u2019s primary measures were unchanged from the previous year: 12% of children lived in households that had less than 50% of the median household income before housing costs, and 15% after housing costs. 10.3% were living in material hardship \u2013 where they frequently went without basic essentials such as nutritious food, clothing, and doctors\u2019 visits.

Draped in an Aboriginal flag, Thorpe struggled with police before she was stopped by them; she returned to the pro-trans rights rally to cheers. Pro-trans rights protesters, led by Thorpe and Australian Greens senator Janet Rice, significantly outnumbered those supporting Keen, the controversial British activist. Thorpe, who recently staged a protest attempting to block the Sydney Mardi Gras parade to protest Indigenous deaths in custody, said she had moved on Keen to protest homophobia and transphobia. \u201cAs a sovereign black woman I\u2019ve come to let these people know that they are not welcome on this country,\u201d Thorpe told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe do not tolerate this \u2026 on Ngunnawal and Ngambri country. \u201cThis government need to answer why these people are allowed into this country.\u201d Thorpe also complained about her treatment by Australian federal police, alleging that it constituted assault.

In January, the Greens MP Stephen Bates wrote to the immigration minister, Andrew Giles, calling on him to revoke Keen\u2019s visa, but the request was referred to the department. Outside Parliament House in Canberra on Thursday, the trans rights protesters referred to the Melbourne rally with a chant of \u201cPosie Parker, you can\u2019t hide, you\u2019ve got Nazis on your side\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In a tightly cropped video streaming on social media, Parker claimed this was an attempt to \u201csilence\u201d her and that she had been \u201caggressed upon\u201d, as the pro-trans rally maintained a distance of 50 metres. Hanson was challenged by one anti-trans rights protester with the question: \u201cWhat are One Nation going to do about it?\u201d Hanson replied that the party could \u201cmake a difference if you give us the power to do it\u201d by putting the minor party in the balance of power. With its two senators, One Nation is already in the balance of power. Hanson noted that the party\u2019s motions, such as one banning gender reassignment surgery for children aged under 18, had been defeated by major parties who are \u201cnot interested\u201d in the issue. On the sidelines of the protest, UAP\u2019s Babet noted there was \u201cnobody here from the Coalition\u201d, labelling them \u201cweak and gutless\u201d in comments to Guardian Australia. Earlier, the Liberal MP Bridget Archer told ABC Radio that organisers had \u201calmost stopped pretending that it\u2019s about women\u2019s rights and they are openly saying that it is an anti-transgender protest\u201d. \u201cIf they want to talk about women\u2019s safety, I don\u2019t think that the issue of \u2026 same-sex bathrooms is where the issue of women\u2019s safety is at,\u201d she said. \u201cThe most unsafe place for women to be is in their own homes. \u201cIn terms of safety, the transgender community have much higher rates of violence perpetrated against them than even women do, so I think it\u2019s just nonsense.\u201d No Coalition parliamentarians were in attendance at Keen\u2019s rally. This week the Liberal senators Alex Antic and Hollie Hughes publicly defended Victorian MP Moira Deeming against a push to expel her by the Victorian Liberal leader, John Pesutto, after Deeming attended Keen\u2019s rally in Melbourne on Saturday. Deeming has denied any wrongdoing and condemned the attendance of neo-Nazis at that rally, calling them gatecrashers.

Four years ago, the engineer wife of a former minister was considering leaving the country for the US or Britain, or at least going on a cruise. The self-declared idealist was \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d with how Africa\u2019s most populous country was being run. \u201cI told everybody I was done with politics and went indoors,\u201d she said in an interview. Not long after, Kingibe\u2019s phone started buzzing; minor parties were impressed by her independent spirit. In 2022, she joined the Labour party, led by the outsider presidential candidate Peter Obi, and then in last month\u2019s elections the 68-year-old was the surprise winner in the race to become senator for the capital, Abuja. In a move practically unheard of in Nigeria, Kingibe has pledged to donate her salary to an \u201cemergency\u201d fund to support her policies, which are focused on redistributing wealth in the city and its poor rural environs.\n\u201cI see so much wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cI see so much that can be improved on, and I also see that most of the people that have been in the National Assembly \u2026 They are more concerned about how much money they\u2019re going to make as opposed to what can be done for the people.\u201d Nigeria faces rampant financial insecurity and a crisis-riddled economy, while corruption is endemic. After the underwhelming eight-year presidency of Muhammadu Buhari, the country has elected as its next leader the ruling party\u2019s candidate Bola Tinubu, 70, a wealthy political veteran and former governor of Lagos. Though he fell well short of power, Obi mounted the first serious challenge to Nigeria\u2019s two major parties since the return of civil rule more than two decades ago. He upset the odds to win the most votes in Abuja, the capital, and Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s mammoth melting pot. In the Abuja senatorial race, Kingibe unseated the incumbent, Philip Aduda, who had held the capital for 12 years, taking more than double his votes. She became the first female senator of the city in 20 years.\nHer plans include providing water to poorer parts of Abuja, accessing federal funds for health and education and supporting farmers, of which there are many in the capital territory that makes up her constituency. \u201c[My values are] integrity, fairness, the more privileged should look out for the less privileged,\u201d she said. \u201cI keep saying society is judged by how more privileged members treat the less privileged.\u201d Those politics are unusually progressive in oil-rich Nigeria \u2013 and certainly to the left of Obi, who focused his presidential run on good governance. Her success in Abuja suggests things may be changing, if slowly. One metric that is only going backwards, however, is female representation. Nigeria elected just 18 women to its 469-seat parliament in last month\u2019s election, down from 21 in the last general election in 2019. The number of women in the senate is falling from eight to three. Those figures leave Nigeria 180th out of 186 countries ranked by the Inter-Parliamentary Union for female parliamentary representation, and last in Africa. Abosede George-Ogan, founder of Nigeria\u2019s Women in Leadership Advancement Network, said political parties had female quotas enshrined in their constitutions but none paid attention to them. According to her, it takes about 5bn naira (about \u00a39m) to run for governor, for example. \u201cHow many women have N5bn?\u201d she said. Another \u201cvery serious deterrent\u201d for women is violence, Kingibe said. Politicians are regular targets; Obi\u2019s candidate for governor of Enugu state was shot dead last month. Two female local candidates on a recent discussion programme described having been shot. George-Ogan said there was also a wider perception in patriarchal Nigeria that women are \u201ccarers and nurturers\u201d, not leaders. In media interviews they are often asked about family, children and the home, while men are asked about the economy.\nFor Kingibe and George-Ogan, the only solution is legislation. Women staged protests last year after parliament rejected a constitutional amendment that would have reserved special seats for them in national and state assemblies. Some have proposed a 30% minimum quota in parliament. Nigerian banks imposed a similar rule for their boards a decade ago.

For now, Kingibe said she would try to make a difference in politics by actively pushing for more female councillors and chair people in the Labour party. She also wants to set up a national lobby for women across parties and among activists.

But when he arrived in the city, he found it wasn\u2019t just the business opportunities that made the move worthwhile; it was also the change of pace.</p>"}}, {"type": "image", "assets": [{"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/aed50df485d23bbc29b60a559143f19c7ca923ba/0_393_2026_1434/2026.jpg", "typeData": {"width": 2026, "height": 1434}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/aed50df485d23bbc29b60a559143f19c7ca923ba/0_393_2026_1434/master/2026.jpg", "typeData": {"width": 2026, "height": 1434, "isMaster": true}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/aed50df485d23bbc29b60a559143f19c7ca923ba/0_393_2026_1434/2000.jpg", "typeData": {"width": 2000, "height": 1416}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/aed50df485d23bbc29b60a559143f19c7ca923ba/0_393_2026_1434/1000.jpg", "typeData": {"width": 1000, "height": 708}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/aed50df485d23bbc29b60a559143f19c7ca923ba/0_393_2026_1434/500.jpg", "typeData": {"width": 500, "height": 354}}, {"type": "image", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "file": "https://media.guim.co.uk/aed50df485d23bbc29b60a559143f19c7ca923ba/0_393_2026_1434/140.jpg", "typeData": {"width": 140, "height": 99}}], "imageTypeData": {"displayCredit": false, "credit": "Photograph: SA Gov", "source": "SA Gov", "photographer": "SA Gov", "alt": "Nithesh Pushparaj is the CEO of TAV Systems", "mediaId": "aed50df485d23bbc29b60a559143f19c7ca923ba", "mediaApiUri": "https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/aed50df485d23bbc29b60a559143f19c7ca923ba", "imageType": "Photograph"}}, {"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<ul> \n <li><p>Nithesh Pushparaj, CEO of TAV Systems.

The death of Kane Te Tai, 38, was confirmed by New Zealand\u2019s foreign ministry Thursday, citing Ukrainian government sources. Te Tai, who fought with the International Legion, is the third New Zealander known to have died in Ukraine. For many in New Zealand, Te Tai was the face of the country\u2019s unofficial involvement in Ukraine\u2019s war. He fundraised for equipment and undertook news interviews before he left New Zealand in May 2022, and documented his friendships, battles and daily life on Instagram and Facebook. A video he posted earlier this month recorded the moment when he was unexpectedly reunited with a Ukrainian friend who had been held hostage for months by Russian troops, and whom Te Tai recognised when the man began to call out, \u201cNew Zealand! New Zealand!\u201d \u201cMy brother!\u201d Te Tai replied. Last April, Te Tai told TVNZ that he would leave his job at a construction hire company and travel to Ukraine, \u201cto help in any capacity I can.\u201d He was one of a number of foreign fighters \u2013 estimated to be in the low thousands \u2013 who have traveled to the conflict since Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed for volunteers from abroad last February. At least eight Britons, seven Americans and four Georgians are among those who have died in the war against Russia. Te Tai \u2013 who served for almost a decade in New Zealand\u2019s army, including in Afghanistan \u2013 had posted tributes on social media to members of the International Legion who had died. Last month, he was interviewed in a CNN story about the group \u2013 using his call sign, Turtle \u2013 where he was credited as his unit\u2019s leader. The story showed the group training new recruits near the embattled town of Vuhledar, close to the frontline. \u201cThere is such a lot of emotion within these fights,\u201d Te Tai told CNN. \u201cMainly because from a lot of what I\u2019ve seen, they [Russian soldiers] don\u2019t want to be here either.\u201d After leaving the army in 2010, Te Tai co-founded a charitable trust to support veterans\u2019 mental health; Aaron Wood, the joint founder, said in a statement posted to Facebook on Tuesday that he had been told of Te Tai\u2019s death and wanted to help to arrange the retrieval of his body. \u201cKane had a huge heart and loved helping people,\u201d Wood wrote. He told the Guardian on Thursday that his friend had helped a number of New Zealand veterans to access mental health support in the past five years. Te Tai\u2019s mother told RNZ she had heard of her son\u2019s death via his contacts in Ukraine. He was \u201can awesome father, awesome son, awesome uncle and brother,\u201d she added. New Zealand\u2019s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it was \u201caware of reports\u201d that a New Zealander had been killed there and confirmed Te Tai\u2019s death on Thursday. The country\u2019s embassy in Warsaw is attempting to learn further details, a statement said. New Zealand soldiers have been formally deployed to the UK to train Ukrainian troops, but the country has no military presence on the ground in Ukraine. The defence ministry has acknowledged that an unknown number of current or former soldiers could be on the frontline in their own capacity. Dominic Abelen \u2013 a New Zealand soldier who was on leave without pay from the army \u2013 was killed in August during combat in Donetsk. He had not told the army he was going to Ukraine and did not seek permission to travel there. In January, Andrew Bagshaw \u2013 a dual British-New Zealand national who had travelled to Ukraine from Christchurch where he was a research scientist \u2013 was killed during a humanitarian mission, also in eastern Ukraine. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister Chris Hipkins told reporters on Wednesday that the war in Ukraine was \u201cunjust\u201d and \u201can illegal invasion by Russia.\u201d But he urged New Zealanders not to travel there. Te Tai had read online of an $11m NZD reward for his death offered by Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenary group, Wood said. \u201cHe joked about turning himself in so he could collect it.\u201d On Sunday, Te Tai told Wood in WhatsApp messages that after 10 months of combat, he had been training his replacement and intended to leave Ukraine for good in the next fortnight. \u201cHe wrote, \u2018That\u2019s enough war for me,\u2019\u201d Wood said. He added that Te Tai loved Ukraine, but wrote: \u201cBefore the game gets me or before I just decide that life here is too easy, maybe it\u2019s time to start living my real life.\u201d", "charCount": "4444", "shouldHideReaderRevenue": "false", "showAffiliateLinks": "false", "bylineHtml": "<a href=\"profile/charlotte-graham-mclay\">Charlotte Graham-McLay</a> in Wellington", "showTableOfContents": "false"}, "tags": [{"id": "world/newzealand", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webTitle": "New Zealand", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/newzealand", "references": []}, {"id": "world/ukraine", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webTitle": "Ukraine", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/ukraine", "references": []}, {"id": "world/asia-pacific", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webTitle": "Asia Pacific", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/asia-pacific", "references": []}, {"id": "world/europe-news", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webTitle": "Europe", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news", "references": []}, {"id": "world/world", "type": "keyword", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webTitle": "World news", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/world", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/world", "references": []}, {"id": "type/article", "type": "type", "webTitle": "Article", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/articles", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article", "references": []}, {"id": "tone/news", "type": "tone", "webTitle": "News", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news", "references": []}, {"id": "profile/charlotte-graham-mclay", "type": "contributor", "webTitle": "Charlotte Graham-McLay", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/charlotte-graham-mclay", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/charlotte-graham-mclay", "references": [], "bio": "<p>Charlotte Graham-McLay is a freelance journalist based in Wellington</p>", "firstName": "Charlotte", "lastName": "Graham-McLay"}, {"id": "tracking/commissioningdesk/new-zealand", "type": "tracking", "webTitle": "New Zealand", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/new-zealand", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/new-zealand", "references": []}], "references": [], "blocks": {"main": {"id": "641bc8cd8f0823818506b9a5", "bodyHtml": "<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de2e9ba375f63f81dba599c129e5e75317091f8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de2e9ba375f63f81dba599c129e5e75317091f8c/65_0_2099_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former New Zealand soldier Kane Te Tai\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former New Zealand soldier Kane Te Tai has been killed in Ukraine.

The death of Kane Te Tai, 38, was confirmed by New Zealand\u2019s foreign ministry Thursday, citing Ukrainian government sources. Te Tai, who fought with the International Legion, is the third New Zealander known to have died in Ukraine. For many in New Zealand, Te Tai was the face of the country\u2019s unofficial involvement in Ukraine\u2019s war. He fundraised for equipment and undertook news interviews before he left New Zealand in May 2022, and documented his friendships, battles and daily life on Instagram and Facebook. A video he posted earlier this month recorded the moment when he was unexpectedly reunited with a Ukrainian friend who had been held hostage for months by Russian troops, and whom Te Tai recognised when the man began to call out, \u201cNew Zealand! New Zealand!\u201d \u201cMy brother!\u201d Te Tai replied.\nLast April, Te Tai told TVNZ that he would leave his job at a construction hire company and travel to Ukraine, \u201cto help in any capacity I can.\u201d He was one of a number of foreign fighters \u2013 estimated to be in the low thousands \u2013 who have traveled to the conflict since Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed for volunteers from abroad last February.\nAt least eight Britons, seven Americans and four Georgians are among those who have died in the war against Russia.

The comments made last Thursday at a candidate forum run contradictory to the premier\u2019s promise not to sell off any more of the state\u2019s assets and come amid political attacks from Labor asserting more privatisations would take place under a reelected Perrottet government.\nAsked if she supported asset sales to fund government debt, Wilson said the government had \u201cundertaken a whole tranche of asset recycling initiatives to fund infrastructure, not to fund government debt\u201d. \u201cWhat we do as a NSW Liberal government \u2013 and we would continue to do this with a range of different projects \u2013 is to ensure that we can continue to get more equity on to the balance sheet so that we can invest in more income-producing and productivity-enhancing infrastructure projects,\u201d she said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cThese are the kind of projects that have changed people\u2019s lives and we are actually really proud of our record in ensuring that we can deliver that.\u201d She said the government\u2019s record of selling off government assets had allowed the state to invest in schools, infrastructure projects and the health system. \u201cWe as NSW Liberals support asset recycling but it has to be for the infrastructure that we need and for the infrastructure that will make a difference to people\u2019s lives,\u201d she said. Wilson is trying to save the seat she holds on an 11% margin from the teal challenger Helen Conway who told the forum she did not support further privatisation. \u201cThis money that was raised did not go into schools or public transport \u2026 it went into projects that were incompetently managed,\u201d Conway said. Grilled on his asset recycling at the final leaders debate on Wednesday evening in Penrith, Perrottet insisted he had ruled out further privatisation but that it had previously allowed the government to \u201cturbocharge\u201d infrastructure. Labor has repeatedly questioned if the premier\u2019s pledge not to sell any more government assets in the next term was genuine. The opposition Treasury spokesperson, Daniel Mookhey, insisted the comments from Wilson were a signal a Coalition government would sell off Sydney Water \u2013 a plan they have denied repeatedly throughout the campaign.\n\u201cDespite Dominic Perrottet\u2019s denials, we have another senior Liberal talking about asset recycling and the government\u2019s secret privatisation agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it with tolls, we\u2019ve seen it with electricity prices, and if Dominic Perrottet gets another four more years, we\u2019ll see Sydney Water privatised. \u201cThere is not an asset the Liberals won\u2019t sell \u2013 but the end result is always the same \u2013 people will pay more in the long run.\u201d Asked about the comments on Wednesday, Wilson insisted \u201ca reelected Liberal government will not be privatising assets\u201d.

We only just saw him for the first time this morning. He\u2019s had the flu and and those types of things. So that gives Nestor the chance to be in the 26-man squad, and we\u2019ll see how the game goes.\u201d Should Irankunda be handed his first cap he would be younger than Australia\u2019s youngest international debutant to date, Duncan Cummings, who was 17 years and 139 days when when debuted against China in 1975. It is not outside the realms of possibility, either, given the impression he has made in camp in Sydney, with striker Mitchell Duke describing him as \u201ca freak\u201d. \u201cNestor has all the ability in the world,\u201d Adelaide assistant coach and former Socceroos captain, Mark Milligan, said on Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s still very young, and I think in this day and age the expectation can come a lot quicker than what it used to, with social media and things like that \u2026 but with them naming him as a train-on they sort of manage those expectations. \u201cFor him to go in and be able to see how the players in the camp behave and conduct themselves, and the processes they go through is a very, very important time for his growth. It\u2019s a fantastic experience for him.

The light aircraft landed at an airstrip in the central Queensland town of Monto to refuel on Tuesday when officers swooped and made five arrests. Five men from NSW, who police allege were part of an organised crime syndicate, were charged with importing a commercial quantity of methamphetamine. They face a maximum penalty of life in prison. Police allege two men had flown a twin-engine Beechcraft aircraft under the radar from a rural area south-west of Sydney on Monday to the PNG town of Bulolo, where they picked up 52kg of methamphetamine. Two pilots and three other men who allegedly provided ground support were arrested on Tuesday in Monto, where police seized five duffle bags allegedly containing the drugs. Kirsty Schofield, assistant commissioner of the AFP, told reporters in Sydney that police allege the men were attempting to establish a supply chain of illicit drugs into Australia through PNG. \u201cWe will allege the man had been meticulously planning this operation for months,\u201d Schofield said. \u201cWhat they did not know however is that law enforcement had been tracking these people for the same period of time.\u201d She said the investigation was a joint operation between the AFP, NSW police and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. \u201cBlack flights\u201d are designed to avoid detection by logging false flight plans or avoiding flight plans entirely, and flying at a low altitude or turning off flight monitoring systems, the AFP said. \u201cIn this case, the aircraft was flying at very low altitude and had its transponder turned off.

Xi has described the Russian president as his \u201cbest friend\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/21/10-years-strengthening-ties-between-putin-xi-china-russia\">has said</a> that their characters are alike.</p> \n<p>It is a relationship that Temur Umarov, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a thinktank, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-visit-to-moscow-showcases-deepening-ties-with-russia-feba99d2?mod=article_inline\">has called</a> a \u201cstrategic bromance\u201d.</p>"}}, {"type": "rich-link", "assets": [], "richLinkTypeData": {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/22/despite-xis-trip-to-russia-dialogue-between-china-and-ukraine-is-still-possible", "originalUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/22/despite-xis-trip-to-russia-dialogue-between-china-and-ukraine-is-still-possible", "linkText": "Despite Xi\u2019s trip to Russia, dialogue between China and Ukraine is still possible", "linkPrefix": "Related: ", "role": "thumbnail"}}, {"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>The depth of that personal relationship only strengthens China\u2019s resolve that the war in Ukraine cannot lead to regime change in the Kremlin, an outcome that analysts believe is possible if the war ends on Ukrainian terms.</p> \n<p>The personal bond is just one of the reasons why Xi\u2019s claims to be a peacemaker in the conflict have been largely dismissed.</p>"}}, {"type": "contentatom", "assets": [], "contentAtomTypeData": {"atomId": "3cb77328-1240-4f09-a434-eb9d1f5adbdc", "atomType": "media", "isMandatory": true}}, {"type": "text", "assets": [], "textTypeData": {"html": "<p>On the first anniversary of the invasion in February, Xi published a 12-point position paper that claimed to offer a way forward for the crisis in Ukraine.

Such a call would have at least been a nod to Xi\u2019s claims to be a neutral mediator. But it didn\u2019t materialise.</p> \n<p>Zelenskiy has welcomed the opportunity to speak to Xi, which may still happen. On Monday an article in the People\u2019s Daily, the Chinese Communist party\u2019s official newspaper, mentioned Zelenskiy by name for the first time since October 2022, according to the China Media Project, a research organisation. That may be an attempt to signal to a domestic audience that the lines of communication between Xi and Zelenskiy are still open.</p> \n<p>Because while Xi may have all but given up on the hope of convincing the west that China is neutral in the Ukraine crisis, at home, and to countries in the global south, he is projecting an image of being a global statesman. The official narrative in China is that the US responds to problems militarily, while China uses dialogue. China can point to the recent restoration of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, brokered by Beijing, as evidence. On Wednesday, US secretary of state Antony Blinken downplayed the extent of China\u2019s involvement, saying Riyadh and Tehran had already been working to patch things up.</p> \n<p>There are signs that this narrative is catching on. Last week an alliance of rebel groups in Myanmar asked for China\u2019s help in defusing the crisis that has ravaged the country since a coup in 2021.</p> \n<p>But Xi\u2019s most important audience is the one at home. Unleashed after three years of zero-Covid, which caused widespread economic pain and social dissatisfaction, Xi is now trying to reassert China\u2019s position on the world stage. Having abolished term limits in 2018, Xi is embarking on his third term as China\u2019s leader, a move unseen since the reign of Mao Zedong. \u201cTherefore it is the year in which you\u2019d expect him to leave more of a footprint,\u201d says Tsang. \u201cSince he has messed up the economy domestically, he is trying to reach out on the foreign policy side, which is in some ways a bit easier.\u201d</p>"}}]}], "totalBodyBlocks": 1}, "rights": {"syndicatable": "true", "subscriptionDatabases": "true", "developerCommunity": "true"}, "section": {"id": "world", "webTitle": "World news", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world", "editions": [{"id": "world", "webTitle": "World news", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world", "code": "default"}]}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "education/2023/mar/23/teacher-vacancies-in-england-93-higher-than-pre-pandemic-study-finds", "type": "article", "sectionId": "education", "sectionName": "Education", "webPublicationDate": "2023-03-23T00:01:41Z", "webTitle": "Teacher vacancies in England 93% higher than pre-pandemic, study finds", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/mar/23/teacher-vacancies-in-england-93-higher-than-pre-pandemic-study-finds", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2023/mar/23/teacher-vacancies-in-england-93-higher-than-pre-pandemic-study-finds", "fields": {"headline": "Teacher vacancies in England 93% higher than pre-pandemic, study finds", "standfirst": "<p>Headteachers forced to use non-specialists as turnover continues, education research body reports</p>", "trailText": "Headteachers forced to use non-specialists as turnover continues, education research body reports", "byline": "Sally Weale Education correspondent", "main": "<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cafec18024b933e5f8320f0469c999f1db1fb3e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cafec18024b933e5f8320f0469c999f1db1fb3e4/0_48_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Headteachers are also having problems recruiting enough teachers for subjects including physics, modern foreign languages and business studies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Headteachers are finding it difficult to recruit in subjects including physics, modern foreign languages and business studies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>", "body": "<p>Teacher vacancies in England have virtually doubled since before Covid, with school leaders increasingly forced to use non-specialist teachers, which threatens to drive down pupil attainment, according to research.</p> <p>A report by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) found that teacher vacancies posted by schools were 93% higher in the academic year up to February 2023 than at the same point in the year before the start of the pandemic.</p> <p>The findings indicate staff turnover is still rising, with vacancies in schools in England up 37% compared with 2021/22. \u201cThis likely indicates that teachers who may have put off the decision to leave teaching during the pandemic are leaving now that the labour market is recovering,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The NFER, which describes itself as the leading independent provider of education research, calls on the government to agree a long-term strategy on teacher pay to try to halt the growing school workforce crisis.</p> <p>The NFER\u2019s annual report on the teacher labour market in England was published on Thursday, after a series of damaging teacher strikes by members of the National Education Union.

A report by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) found that teacher vacancies posted by schools were 93% higher in the academic year up to February 2023 than at the same point in the year before the start of the pandemic. The findings indicate staff turnover is still rising, with vacancies in schools in England up 37% compared with 2021/22. \u201cThis likely indicates that teachers who may have put off the decision to leave teaching during the pandemic are leaving now that the labour market is recovering,\u201d the report said. The NFER, which describes itself as the leading independent provider of education research, calls on the government to agree a long-term strategy on teacher pay to try to halt the growing school workforce crisis. The NFER\u2019s annual report on the teacher labour market in England was published on Thursday, after a series of damaging teacher strikes by members of the National Education Union. They are demanding a fully funded, above-inflation pay rise, which they say will help make the profession more appealing to graduates. The government is currently in talks with unions to try to reach a settlement. \u201cSchools are being forced to stumble from budget to budget and strike to strike without the help of a clear strategy designed to address a worsening recruitment and retention crisis,\u201d said Jack Worth, NFER school workforce lead and co-author of the report. \u201cSchool leaders are increasingly resorting to the use of non-specialist teachers to plug gaps which will ultimately affect pupil attainment outcomes.\u201d\nAs well as the crisis in retaining teachers, the study highlights recruitment problems into the profession, with initial teacher training numbers for 2023/4 significantly below target. Even initial teacher training recruitment to primary schools, which historically has been more secure than secondary, is expected to be 20% or more below target. The same shortfall applies to nine out of 17 secondary subjects, including physics, modern foreign languages, computing, design and technology, business studies and religious education. English, maths, chemistry and geography are also at risk of under-recruiting this year.
